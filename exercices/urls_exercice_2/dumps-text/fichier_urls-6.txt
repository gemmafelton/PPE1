"Racial Crisis in South Africa"

   Address to meeting of Pakistan Institute of International Affairs,
   March 2, 1961 by Dr Yusuf Dadoo

   South Africa has a population of 15 million, of which 12 million are
   non-whites and 3 million are whites. The white people of South Africa
   are a settled community unlike those in the rest of Africa, with the
   exception of Algeria and to some extent Congo. While at the present
   moment many territories in Africa are becoming free, 9 million Algerian
   people are shedding their blood in the struggle for freedom against 15
   million settled French population, and we in South Africa have to
   battle against three million white people. There is no reason why it
   should be so. Insofar as white people are concerned our policy is quite
   clear. We do not say that we want to push the white man into the sea or
   throw him out of the country. Our demand is that democratic rights
   should be enjoyed by all people. There should be equality between man
   and man. There should be no discrimination on grounds of race or
   colour. White and non-white can live peacefully and build a bright
   future for all the people of South Africa. Its natural resources are
   developing and we can all live together in prosperity. But the three
   million whites who have amassed all the power and wealth in their hands
   do not want to give them up. They do not want to give up their
   privileges. They want to maintain white supremacy in South Africa. That
   kind of policy cannot continue. There is bitter opposition to it and in
   the end a bitter struggle might ensue. They cannot for ever maintain
   their supremacy with the force of arms; their police and their military
   cannot subdue 12 million people.

   Apartheid received its greatest condemnation on 21 March last year.
   That is the date of the Sharpeville massacre in which African men,
   women and children protesting against what is known as the pass law
   system were killed. They were demonstrating in a peaceful way. The
   police opened fire on them, is the official number of persons killed in
   one place and there were killings in other places as well. This
   massacre shook the conscience of the world. The matter was raised in
   the Security Council. The apartheid policy and the massacre were
   condemned and the secretary-general was instructed by the Security
   Council to communicate with the South African Government in order to
   see if changes could not be brought about in this whole system of
   apartheid and racial discrimination in the Union of South Africa. A
   year has passed but there has been so far no change on the part of the
   South African Government.

   The question arises why do they persist in this policy, knowing fully
   well that they will have to abandon it sooner or later. They say that
   they want to make South Africa safe for the white people for a thousand
   years. The present rulers of South Africa have been very closely
   following Nazi Germanys policy. They were great supporters of Hitler
   during the war and they opposed the war effort of the South African
   Government. They are fascist-minded and want to hold onto their
   privileges, depending upon the power of the State, its police, military
   and Air Force to keep that power as long as it is possible for them to
   do so.

   Apartheid tyranny The word apartheid, when literally translated into
   English, means separateness. Different racial groups are to live
   separately so that there should be no question of their coming
   together. That is the simple meaning of the word apartheid. But in the
   context of South African politics, it is something more than that. The
   system of apartheid was introduced in the year 1948 by the National
   Party, which is still the ruling party in South Africa. At that time
   Dr. Malan was the leader of the Party. Today Dr. Verwoerd is its
   leader. It is mainly a party of Afrikaans-speaking people, that is,
   people of Dutch origin. Out of three million whites, 60 per cent are
   people of Dutch origin. The remaining 40 per cent are English-speaking
   people. These are mainly of British origin but there are also amongst
   them people from other parts of the continent of Europe.

   In the 1948 election, the first one after the war, the Nationalists
   came out with the policy of apartheid against the traditional policy of
   segregation which successive white Governments had followed. Under the
   policy of segregation, political rights were denied to the non-white
   people. There was segregation in every sphere, so that whites and
   non-whites could not come together. That policy has been followed since
   the time the white people came to South Africa in 1652. They had landed
   at the Cape of Good Hope, which is now Cape Town. They were looking for
   the spices of the East but by accident their ship got wrecked and they
   landed at the Cape. Since then Africans have had to face misery. As the
   white people moved up, they had to fight bitter wars against the
   settled African population. So far as courage and strategy were
   concerned, the African people were better than the white men but the
   latter possessed superior arms. Therefore, gradually the whole of the
   area of the Union of South Africa was swallowed up by the whites. The
   Africans were robbed of their land. There is a saying amongst Africans
   that when the white man first came to South Africa he had the Bible and
   we had the land; now we have the Bible and the white man has the land.

   When at the turn of the century there was a war between the English
   people and the Boers, the Boers were defeated but eventually
   self-government was given and in 1910 the Union was formed. The Act of
   Union prescribed that there should be no rights for the non- white
   people. That was a betrayal on the part of the British Government who
   in spite of the representations made by the organisations of the
   non-white people, sacrificed all their rights and gave a constitution
   in which the non-white people did not get any franchise or any say in
   the affairs of the State.

   Then came the Land Act of 1913, which deprived the African people of
   their land. The result today is that 80 percent of the South African
   population, consisting of non-white people, mostly African, have only
   13 percent of the land and 20 percent of the population that is, the
   whites today own 87 percent of land. One can imagine the land hunger
   and poverty of the African people. Then there were the pass laws which
   control and regulate the freedom of movement of the African people. The
   aim of these measures was to ensure cheap labour for the gold mines,
   which were then thriving, and for the white mans farms. Later, with
   industrial development, there was need for providing cheap labour for
   industries. Cheap labour being thus ensured, the white people benefited
   from it and enjoyed all the prosperity at the expense of the blood,
   sweat and lives of the non whites.

   When the Second World War came there were those who opposed it. But in
   spite of them there was war effort and industrial development took
   place in South Africa. One of the natural consequences of industrial
   development is that there is influx of people from rural areas into
   industrial areas. Precisely the same thing happened in South Africa.
   This influx of non-white people took place in spite of the restrictive
   laws and it could not be stopped. With this contact came the question
   of apartheid. The Nationalist Party, in the interest of the white
   farmers, sponsored the policy of apartheid. In industry there was a
   policy of laissez faire supported by General Smuts who was Prime
   Minister during the war. In 1942 when the Japanese submarines were
   around the African ports, Smuts said 'segregation, is gone. He said
   that in order to mobilise the non-white people in the fight against the
   fascists, people were allowed to come into towns and some form of
   integration was taking place. With industrial development, black people
   came into the towns and naturally mixed with the whites.

   The Nationalist Party demanded that there must be a conscious,
   calculated effort on the part of Government to bring to a halt this
   form of insidious integration. When after the war we had the elections,
   the majority voted the Nationalists into power.

   Since then we have had this policy of apartheid. Every movement of a
   non-white person is controlled or regulated or governed by the laws of
   the country. We thus have in South Africa a system of racial
   discrimination sanctioned by law, which is the worst in the history of
   mankind. Of course, there has been discrimination in many parts of the
   world. People in Asian countries and in other parts of Africa have
   suffered from discrimination of one kind or another. But here is
   discrimination sanctioned by law and enforced by the authority of the
   State against a section of the population on the ground that it is not
   white. Merit does not count. I may be a doctor, but when I walk in the
   street, I am a 'coolie'. People of mixed breed or Coloured people are
   no better treated. That happens in education and in social welfare.
   This kind of system makes life absolutely intolerable.

   Is it surprising that people in South Africa should rise against this
   tyranny? We have been conducting a struggle for 50 years or more.
   Non-white people have had to suffer for it, many have been killed, sent
   to prison or sent out of the country and so on. In this decade, when
   territory after territory in Africa is becoming independent, there is a
   great upsurge on the part of the African people which no one can
   prevent. Freedom is coming to other territories in Africa. That has its
   impact on the non-white people of South Africa, who are determined to
   carry on the struggle to the bitter end. Until they have won their
   freedom, basic human rights and their self-respect, this struggle will
   go on.

   A world-wide struggle What about the other countries of the world? Can
   they do anything to help? The struggle against racial discrimination
   has been a world-wide struggle. A bond of solidarity has existed
   between all those who are engaged in this struggle. The struggle
   against racial discrimination is a part of that against colonialism.
   South Africa constitutes a base against all people striving for freedom
   and equal rights. You have seen what has happened in the Congo. What
   the colonialists gave with one hand, they tried to take back with the
   other. But they will not succeed in their desire in the Congo. The
   Portuguese too will have to forego their African possessions. The
   struggle in Africa is part of a common struggle of the African people.
   The independent African States recognise that fact, and nobody in
   Africa is prepared to tolerate the policy of apartheid followed by Dr.
   Verwoerd.

   At the Commonwealth Prime Ministers conference to be held in London a
   week hence, Dr. Nkrumah, President of Ghana and Alhaji (Tafewa) Balewa
   of Nigeria are bound to make that clear.

   At the time of the last years Conference, a state of emergency was
   declared in South Africa, about 2,000 leaders were arrested and the two
   main political organisations of the African people were declared
   illegal. These organisations are now functioning underground. Most of
   the leaders were arrested but some of us who managed to escape the net
   were asked by our organisations to go out of South Africa to work
   abroad for the cause. Of course we could not have got permission and
   passports to leave South Africa from the Government

   The South African United Front comprises five organisations of South
   Africa and South West Africa. South West Africa is a mandated
   territory, which was given as a trust territory to Britain after the
   First World War. Britain in turn gave it to South Africa to manage it
   as a trust territory. The Government of Dr. Verwoerd has incorporated
   South West Africa into the Union of South Africa, unconstitutionally
   and illegally. The question is before the United Nations as to what
   should be done about it. The matter has been referred to the
   International Court at the Hague. The Government of South Africa is
   trying to find a loophole for maintaining that since no provision was
   made when the United Nations was formed that this territory would go to
   the United Nations, it belongs to South Africa. The United Nations
   itself has not accepted the South African position.

   Boycott South Africa It is our duty to thank the Government and people
   of Pakistan for their constant support in our struggle during all these
   years. We want to thank also the people of other countries that have
   supported us. At the same time we ask them now to do something positive
   and resolute to help us. We demand that there should be a boycott of
   South Africa and it should be isolated in the international field in
   every possible way, diplomatically, culturally, economically. So far as
   this is concerned we are very glad that the independent States of
   Africa at a conference last June resolved not to have diplomatic
   relations with South Africa and that is now being implemented by them.
   They are also considering the question of not allowing South African
   planes to fly over or land in their territories. The African States are
   determined also not to allow South African ships or South African goods
   to come into their territories. The movement is not confined to Africa.
   Malaya has just imposed a trade boycott against South Africa . That has
   also been done by the Caribbean States like Trinidad and Jamaica.

   Then there are voluntary movements for the boycott of South African
   goods. There has been tremendous support for our stand from people in
   Britain, where it is now being officially supported by the Labour Party
   and the Trade Union Congress and unofficially by other organisations. A
   similar movement is afoot in the Scandinavian countries and it has been
   just as successful as that in Britain. To a lesser extent movements of
   this kind are winning support in other European countries and in the
   United States of America.

   For our part we shall not be satisfied with the boycott of South
   African goods. We want economic sanctions against South Africa to be
   imposed by the United Nations. Every year the policy of apartheid has
   been condemned by an overwhelming majority in the United Nations. We
   appeal to the member States of the United Nations to wholeheartedly
   supports the proposal in the General Assembly for imposing economic
   sanctions against South Africa.

   Membership of Commonwealth

   Then there is the question of South Africa's membership of
   Commonwealth, a conference of whose Prime Ministers is to begin on 8
   March in London. We appeal to member States to take steps to exclude
   South Africa from the Commonwealth. South Africa has decided to become
   a republic through a referendum, a referendum which was confined to the
   white people. Eighty percent of the South African population was
   excluded from it. Perhaps we want a republic; but we were not consulted
   about it. When the constitutional form of a member country is changed,
   it has to re-apply for the membership of the Commonwealth. South Africa
   has now to seek admission as a republic. We ask the Prime Ministers of
   all the Commonwealth countries to refuse it admission.

   There are some people who say that if South Africa is thrown out of the
   Commonwealth, there will be no restraining influence on its policies.
   Dr. Verwoerd will impose further restrictive and oppressive measures on
   the people. Would it not be better to have South Africa in the
   Commonwealth so that we might exercise some check on its policies?

   South Africa has been a member of the Commonwealth for many a long year
   but that has not had any restraining effect on its Government. On the
   other hand South Africa has been using its prestige as a member of the
   Commonwealth to further oppress non-white people. The factor of
   economic relations within the Commonwealth has been used by the South
   African Government against the non-white people. You know what will
   happen if South Africa is retained as a member? Dr. Verwoerd will go
   back from the Conference and proclaim to the whites that South Africa
   is still a member of the Commonwealth and he will be acclaimed as a
   hero by them. At the time of the referendum there were some among the
   whites who opposed the creation of a republic on the ground that if
   they did that they would be thrown out of the Commonwealth and isolated
   in the international world. Dr. Verwoerd and his colleagues went round
   the country and assured the white people that nothing of that sort
   would happen and that South Africa would remain a member of the
   Commonwealth. If Dr. Verwoerd goes back successful then he will have
   strengthened his position amongst the white electors, and have a freer
   hand to carry out his detested policies. On the contrary if South
   Africa is excluded from the Commonwealth, that will disillusion the
   whites

   They will then know that these policies will not receive even the tacit
   support of people of the Commonwealth. That will have a salutary effect
   on the whites.

   I must say one thing clearly, namely, that when I speak of white people
   I mean the majority of them. There are brave and courageous whites who
   abhor racial discrimination and apartheid. We respect and love them for
   the sacrifices they have made in common with us for our cause. Some of
   the Church leaders have also supported us. Men like Bishop Reeves and
   Alan Paton, a great writer and author, have had to go out of Africa.
   They had the courage of their convictions to condemn and speak against
   apartheid. There are others like them. There are also white
   industrialists who are perturbed because of the unfavourable reaction
   of the world to South Africa's racial policies. Its economic position
   is affected and people outside no longer look upon South Africa as a
   stable field for investment. By excluding South Africa from the
   Commonwealth you will further isolate it and weaken the position of
   those among the whites who advocate apartheid.

   Tragedy can be averted We do not believe that our battle will be won by
   outside pressure alone. We know that the struggle will have to be
   carried on, as it is being carried on, by our people, legally or
   illegally, openly or underground. As time goes on, that struggle will
   become more bitter and hard. There is still time when external pressure
   can help to shorten the duration of the struggle, to minimise bloodshed
   and violence on the part of the Government and reduce the suffering of
   the people. If timely action is not taken, we may see in South Africa,
   whether we like it or not, a situation similar to that in Algeria,
   perhaps on a bigger scale. That tragedy can be averted only through the
   active intervention of all justice loving people of the world

   We have seen several Prime Ministers and we shall be seeing your
   Foreign Minister. Then we shall go to London. There Dr. Verwoerd will
   face a severe attack from the Prime Minister of the Malayan Federation
   and from other Prime Ministers. The Malayan Prime Minister has made it
   quite clear that the question of apartheid will be raised in the
   Commonwealth Conference in spite of the fact that Mr. Macmillan who
   having spoken of "the wind of change sweeping the Continent of Africa
   has been trying his best that there should be no controversy about it.
   Mr. Diefenbaker too has made his position clear to Mr. Macmillan and so
   has Dr. Nkrumah. So far as others are concerned, they have not yet
   spoken their minds but we know what they think about it. In any case
   Dr. Verwoerd is not going to have an easy time. A policy such as his
   cannot be tolerated in the year 1961 and it cannot last.
