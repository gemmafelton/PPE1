   Protests will never be enough to bring about lasting change. To
   overcome racist thinking, anti-racists must take hold of power - and

   In his keynote address at the Democratic National Convention in Boston
   on 27 July 2004, before 9 million viewers, [88]Barack Obama presented
   himself as the embodiment of racial reconciliation and American
   exceptionalism. He had humble beginnings and a lofty ascent, and in him
   both native and immigrant ancestry and African and European ancestry
   came together. "I stand here knowing that my story is part of the
   larger American story ... and that in no other country on Earth is my
   story even possible," he declared. "America, tonight, if you feel the
   same energy that I do, if you feel the same urgency that I do, if you
   feel the same passion that I do, if you feel the same hopefulness that
   I do, if we do what we must do, then I have no doubt that all across
   the country ... the people will rise up in November, and John Kerry
   will be sworn in as president."

   Kerry lost the election, of course, and Bush seemed poised to embody
   the future of the Republican party. But Barack Obama seemed poised to
   embody the future of the Democratic party.

   Two weeks after his exhilarating keynote address, Barack Obama's
   memoir, [89]Dreams from My Father: A Story of Race and Inheritance, was
   republished. It rushed up the charts and got rave reviews in the final
   months of 2004. Toni Morrison, the queen of American letters, deemed
   Dreams from My Father "quite extraordinary". Obama had written the
   memoir in 1995 as he prepared to begin his political career in the
   Illinois senate. In his most anti-racist passage, Obama reflected on
   assimilated biracial blacks like "poor Joyce," his friend at Occidental
   College in Los Angeles. In Joyce and other black students, he "kept
   recognising pieces of myself", Obama wrote. People like Joyce spoke
   about "the richness of their multicultural heritage, and it sounded
   real good, until you noticed that they avoided black people. It wasn't
   a matter of conscious choice, necessarily, just a matter of
   gravitational pull, the way integration always worked, a one-way
   street. The minority assimilated into the dominant culture, not the
   other way around. Only white culture could be `neutral' and
   `objective'. Only white culture could be `nonracial' ... Only white
   culture had `individuals'."

   Obama's anti-racist litany continued in his critical revelation of the
   "extraordinary negro" complex. "We, the half-breeds and the
   college-degreed ... [are] never so outraged as when a cabbie drives
   past us or the woman in the elevator clutches her purse, not so much
   because we're bothered by the fact that such indignities are what less
   fortunate coloureds have to put up with every single day of their lives
   - although that's what we tell ourselves - but because [we] ... have
   somehow been mistaken for an ordinary nigger. Don't you know who I am?
   I'm an individual!"

   Ironically, racist Americans of all colours would in 2004 begin hailing
   Barack Obama, with all his public intelligence, morality, speaking
   ability and political success, as the extraordinary negro. The
   extraordinary-negro hallmark had come a mighty long way from the poet
   Phillis Wheatley to Barack Obama, who became the nation's only African
   American in the US senate in 2005. Since Wheatley, segregationists had
   despised these extraordinary-negro exhibits of black capability and had
   done everything to take them down. But Obama - or rather Obama's era -
   was different. Segregationists turned their backs on their predecessors
   and adored the Obama exhibit as a proclamation of the end of racism.
   They wanted to end the discourse on discrimination.
     __________________________________________________________________

   "He's the first mainstream African American who is articulate and
   bright and clean and a nice-looking guy." Presidential hopeful and
   Delaware senator Joe Biden might as well have labelled Barack Obama the
   extraordinary negro. Biden's evaluations of his presidential rivals
   appeared in the New York Observer days before Obama stood in front of
   the Old State Capitol building in Springfield, Illinois, and formally
   announced his presidential candidacy on 10 February 2007. Obama brimmed
   with words of American unity, hope and change.

   But Joe Biden's comments - which he later "deeply" regretted - became a
   sign of things to come. What was to come over the course of the
   campaign was a reflection of the audacity of racist minds - from George
   W Bush to radio mega-personality Rush Limbaugh to Democratic stalwarts
   - who all viewed Obama as an extraordinary negro. In February 2007,
   Time magazine speculated that African Americans were expressing greater
   support for New York senator [90]Hillary Clinton because of questions
   over whether Obama was "black enough". It couldn't be because they saw
   Obama as a long shot. It had to be that they did not see Obama as
   ordinarily black like them, meaning inarticulate and ugly and unclean
   and unintelligent.

   Pundits were dubbing Hillary Clinton the "inevitable" nominee until
   Barack Obama upset her on 3 January 2008, in the Iowa primary. By Super
   Tuesday on 5 February 2008, Americans had been swept up in the Obama
   "Yes We Can" crusade of hope and change - themes he embodied and spoke
   about so eloquently in his stump speeches that people started to
   hunger. In mid-February, his perceptive and brilliant wife, Michelle
   Obama, told a Milwaukee rally: "For the first time in my adult life, I
   am really proud of my country, and not just because Barack has done
   well, but because I think people are hungry for change."

   Racist commentators searched for dirt on the Obamas. When no dirt could
   be found, investigative reporters started checking their associates. In
   early March 2008, ABC News released snippets of sermons from one of
   black America's most revered liberation theologians, the recently
   retired pastor of Chicago's large Trinity United Church of Christ.
   Jeremiah Wright had married the Obamas and had baptised their two
   daughters. In an ABC News report, Wright was quoted proclaiming, in a
   sermon, that "the government gives them the drugs, builds bigger
   prisons, passes a three-strike law and then wants us to sing `God Bless
   America'. No, no, no ... God damn America for treating our citizens as
   less than human." Wright had discarded the very old racist lesson that
   had first been taught to slaves: that African Americans were supposed
   to love the US and consider it the world's greatest country, no matter
   how they were treated. On top of his rejection of American
   exceptionalism, Wright had the audacity to preach that American
   "terrorism" abroad had helped bring on the tragic events of 9/11. To
   put it lightly, Americans everywhere were livid.

   When Obama's flippant characterisations of Wright as a fraught "old
   uncle" did not calm Americans down, Obama decided to address the
   controversy. On 18 March 2008, he stepped into the spotlight and gave a
   "race speech," entitled A More Perfect Union, at Philadelphia's
   National Constitutional Center. Having taught constitutional law,
   worked in civil rights law, and overseen successful political campaigns
   (including his current campaign, which analysts were already regarding
   as masterful), Obama could easily be regarded as an expert on many
   things: constitutional law, civil rights law, Chicago politics,
   Illinois politics, campaigning, and race and politics.

   Obama dismissed Jeremiah Wright's "profoundly distorted view", but
   courageously refused to totally disown Wright. And then he opened his
   general lecture on race, explaining that socioeconomic racial
   inequities stemmed from the history of discrimination. From this firm
   anti-racist opening, he pivoted to the consensus racist theory of the
   "pervasive achievement gap", to the disproven racist theory of "the
   erosion of black families" that "welfare policies ... may have
   worsened", and to the unproven racist theory that racial discrimination
   had bequeathed blacks a "legacy of defeat". According to Obama, this
   "legacy of defeat" explained why "young men and, increasingly, young
   women" were "standing on street corners or languishing in our prisons".
   He ignored the fact that this population was facing some of the
   nation's highest unemployment and policing rates.

   Those anti-racists like Jeremiah Wright, their "anger is not always
   productive", Obama continued. "Indeed, all too often it distracts
   attention from solving real problems; it keeps us from squarely facing
   our own complicity within the African American community in our
   condition."

   It was a classic assimilationist retort: calling anti-racists "angry"
   for truly believing in racial equality, for not seeing anything wrong
   with black people, and for seeing everything wrong with discrimination.
   Like civil rights activists [91]WEB Du Bois and [92]Martin Luther King
   before him, Obama lumped these "angry" anti-racists in with angry,
   anti-white cynics to discredit them and distinguish himself from them.
   But Du Bois and King ultimately had to ward off the same "angry" and
   anti-white labels they had helped to produce. And now, Obama was doing
   the same thing, unaware that he was reproducing a label that his
   opponents would stamp on to him whenever and wherever he uttered
   another anti-racist word after this speech.

   Barack Obama's 2008 speech at the National Constitution Center in
   Philadelphia

   Obama encouraged African Americans to fight discrimination, take
   personal responsibility, be better parents and end the "legacy of
   defeat". Obama did not offer any childrearing or psychological lessons
   for the presumably parentally and psychologically superior white
   Americans. He merely asked them to join him on the "long march" against
   racial discrimination - "not just with words but with deeds". He left
   the Philadelphia platform on 18 March 2008, as he began, expressing the
   half-truthful analogy of continuous racial progression. "This union may
   never be perfect," he said, "but generation after generation has shown
   that it can always be perfected."

   Segregationist and anti-racist critiques were drowned out by the
   eruption of praise across the ideological aisle. MSNBC political
   analyst Michelle Bernard framed it as "the best speech and most
   important speech on race that we have heard as a nation since Martin
   Luther King's `I Have a Dream' speech". And it was not just Democrats
   who were fawning. Prominent Republicans - everyone from presidential
   candidates Mike Huckabee and John McCain to the Bush administration's
   Condoleezza Rice and Colin Powell, and the Clintons' old foe, Newt
   Gingrich - were also praising the speech.

   Meanwhile, Republican producers of racist ideas got down to business,
   demanding to see [94]Obama's birth certificate, questioning whether
   Barack Hussein Obama was really an American, and suggesting that only
   real Americans, who were white like McCain, could live in the White
   House of the United States. The Obama campaign released [95]a scanned
   copy of his US birth certificate, but the rumours of Obama being born
   in Kenya or some Islamic anti-American nation did not suddenly go away.
   They were not started out of ignorance, so why would they go away out
   of knowledge?
     __________________________________________________________________

   On 4 November 2008, a 64-year-old recently retired professor cast a
   vote for a major political party for the first time in her voting life.
   She had retired from academia, but not from her very public activism of
   four decades. She was still travelling the country trying to rouse an
   abolitionist movement against prisons. In casting her vote for Democrat
   Barack Obama, [96]Angela Davis joined roughly 69.5 million Americans.
   But more than voting for the man, Davis voted for the grassroots
   efforts of the campaign organisers, those millions of people demanding
   change.

   When the networks started announcing that Obama had been elected the
   44th president of the United States, happiness exploded from coast to
   coast, and from the US around the anti-racist world. Davis was in the
   delirium of Oakland, California. People she did not know came up and
   hugged her as she walked along the streets. She saw people singing and
   dancing. And the people [97]Angela Davis saw and all the others around
   the world who were celebrating were not enraptured from the election of
   an individual; they were enraptured by the pride of the victory for
   black people, by the success of millions of grassroots organisers, and
   because they had shown all those disbelievers, who had said that
   electing a black president was impossible, to be wrong. Most of all,
   they were enraptured by the anti-racist potential of a black president.

   Behind the scenes of exploding happiness that November night and over
   the next few weeks, was the exploding fury of hate attacks on black
   people. The establishment was working overtime to take down some of the
   colour-blind rhetoric that had prevented consumers from seeing
   discrimination for a decade. It was working to put up something better:
   a portrait of America conveying that there was no longer any need for
   protective or affirmative civil rights laws and policies - and no
   longer any need to ever talk about race. "Are we now in a post-racial
   America? ... Is America past racism against black people?" John
   McWhorter, professor at Columbia, asked in Forbes weeks after the
   election. "I say the answer is yes."
     __________________________________________________________________

   When will the day arrive when black lives matter to Americans? It
   depends largely on what anti-racists do - and on the strategies they
   use to stamp out racist ideas. Racial reformers have customarily
   requested or demanded that Americans, particularly white Americans,
   sacrifice their own privileges for the betterment of black people. And
   yet, this strategy is based on one of the oldest myths of the modern
   era, a myth continuously produced and reproduced by racists and
   anti-racists alike: that racism materially benefits the majority of
   white people, that white people would lose and not gain in the
   reconstruction of an anti-racist America.

   It has been true that racist policies have benefited white people in
   general at the expense of black people (and others) in general. That is
   the story of racism, of unequal opportunity in a nutshell. But it is
   also true that a society of equal opportunity, without a top 1%
   hoarding the wealth and power, would actually benefit the vast majority
   of white people much more than racism does.

   Anti-racists should stop connecting selfishness to racism, and
   unselfishness to anti-racism. Altruism is wanted, not required.
   Anti-racists do not have to be altruistic. Anti-racists do not have to
   be selfless. Anti-racists merely have to have intelligent
   self-interest, and to stop consuming those racist ideas that have
   engendered so much unintelligent self-interest over the years. It is in
   the intelligent self-interest of middle- and upper-income blacks to
   challenge the racism affecting the black poor, knowing they will not be
   free of the racism that is slowing their socio-economic rise until poor
   blacks are free of racism.

   It is in the intelligent self-interest of white Americans to challenge
   racism, knowing they will not be free of sexism, class bias, homophobia
   and ethnocentrism until black people are free of racism. The histories
   of anti-Asian, anti-Native and anti-Latina/o racist ideas; the
   histories of sexist, elitist, homophobic, and ethnocentric ideas: all
   sound eerily similar to this history of racist ideas, and feature some
   of the same defenders of bigotry in America. Supporting these
   prevailing bigotries is only in the intelligent self-interest of a tiny
   group of super-rich, Protestant, heterosexual, non-immigrant, white,
   Anglo-Saxon males. Those are the only people who need to be altruistic
   in order to be anti-racist. The rest of us merely need to do the
   intelligent thing for ourselves.

   Historically, black people have by and large worked out that the
   smartest thing we could do for ourselves is to promote the notion of
   uplift. Beginning around the 1790s, abolitionists urged the growing
   number of free blacks to exhibit upstanding behaviour in front of white
   people, believing they would thereby undermine the racist beliefs
   behind slavery. Black people would acquire "the esteem, confidence and
   patronage of the whites, in proportion to your increase in knowledge
   and moral improvement," as the abolitionist William Lloyd Garrison
   lectured free blacks in the 1830s.

   History shows not only that uplift has failed, but that, generally
   speaking, the opposite of its intended effect has occurred. Racist
   Americans have routinely despised those black Americans the most who
   uplifted themselves, who defied those racist laws and theories that
   individuals employed to keep them down. So upwardly mobile black people
   have not persuaded away racist ideas or policies. Quite the contrary.
   Uplift has brought on the progression of new racist policies and ideas
   after blacks broke through the old ones.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Everyone who has witnessed the historic presidency of Barack Obama -
   and the historic opposition to him - should now know full well that the
   more black people uplift themselves, the more they will find themselves
   on the receiving end of a racist backlash. Uplift, as a strategy for
   racial progress, has failed. Black individuals must stop worrying about
   what other people may think about them. Individual blacks are not race
   representatives. They are not responsible for those Americans who hold
   racist ideas. Black people need to be their imperfect selves around
   white people, around each other, around all people. Black is beautiful
   and ugly, intelligent and unintelligent, law-abiding and law-breaking,
   industrious and lazy - and it is those imperfections that make black
   people human, make black people equal to all other imperfectly human
   groups.

   The other major strategy that racial reformers have used is educational
   persuasion. As a strategy for racial progress, educational persuasion
   has failed, because it has been predicated on the false construction of
   the race problem: the idea that ignorance and hate lead to racist
   ideas, which lead to racist policies. In fact, self-interest leads to
   racist policies, which lead to racist ideas, leading to all the
   ignorance and hate.

   Racist policies were created out of self-interest. And so, they have
   usually been voluntarily rolled back out of self-interest. The popular
   and glorious version of history saying that abolitionists and civil
   rights activists have steadily educated and persuaded away American
   racist ideas and policies sounds great. But it has never been the
   complete story, or even the main story. Politicians passed the civil
   and voting rights measures in the 1860s and the 1960s primarily out of
   political and economic self-interest - not an educational or moral
   awakening. And these laws did not spell the doom of racist policies.
   The racist policies simply evolved. There has been a not-so-glorious
   progression of racism, and educational persuasion has failed to stop
   it, and Americans have failed to recognise it.

   History is clear. Sacrifice, uplift, persuasion and education have not
   eradicated, are not eradicating, and will not eradicate racist ideas,
   let alone racist policies. Power will never sacrifice self-interest,
   cannot be educated away from its self-interest. Those who have the
   power to abolish racial discrimination have not done so thus far, and
   they will never do so as long as racism benefits them in some way.

   I am certainly not stating that there are no Americans in positions of
   power who have ever tried to end racial disparities in their sphere of
   influence. But these courageous anti-racist powerbrokers are more the
   exception than the rule. As Americans have discarded old racist ideas,
   new racist ideas have constantly been produced for their consumption.
   That's why the effort to educate and persuade away racist ideas has
   been a never-ending affair in America. That's why education will never
   bring into being an anti-racist America.

   To undermine racial discrimination, Americans must focus their efforts
   on those who have the power to undermine racial discrimination. History
   has shown that those Americans who have had the power to undermine
   racial discrimination have rarely done so. They have done so, however,
   when they realised that eliminating some form of racial discrimination
   was in their interest, much as Abraham Lincoln chose to end slavery to
   save the union. They have also conceded to anti-racist change as a
   better alternative than the disruptive, disordered, politically harmful
   and/or unprofitable conditions that anti-racist protesters created.

   The most effective protests have been fiercely local; they are protests
   started by anti-racists focusing on their immediate surroundings: their
   blocks, neighbourhoods, schools, colleges, jobs and professions. These
   local protests have then become statewide protests, and statewide
   protests have then become national protests, and national protests have
   then become international protests. But it all starts with one person,
   or two people, or tiny groups, in their small surroundings, engaging in
   energetic mobilisation of anti-racists into organisations; and
   chess-like planning and adjustments during strikes, occupations,
   insurrections, campaigns and fiscal and bodily boycotts, among a series
   of other tactics to force power to eradicate racist policies.
   Anti-racist protesters have created positions of power for themselves
   by articulating clear demands and making it even clearer that they will
   not stop - and that policing forces cannot stop them - until their
   demands are met.

   But protesting against racist policies can never be a long-term
   solution to eradicating racial discrimination in America. Just as one
   generation of powerful Americans could decide or be pressured by
   protest to end racial discrimination, when the conditions and interests
   change, another generation could once again encourage racial
   discrimination. That's why protesting against racist power has been a
   never-ending affair in America.

   Protesting against racist power and succeeding can never be mistaken
   for seizing power. Any effective solution to eradicating American
   racism must involve Americans committed to anti-racist policies seizing
   and maintaining power over institutions, neighbourhoods, counties,
   states, nations - the world. It makes no sense to sit back and put the
   future in the hands of people committed to racist policies, or people
   who sail with the wind of self-interest. An anti-racist America can
   only be guaranteed if principled anti-racists are in power, and then
   anti-racist policies become the law of the land, and then anti-racist
   ideas become the common sense of the people, and then the anti-racist
   common sense of the people holds those anti-racist leaders and policies
   accountable.

   And that day is sure to come. No power lasts for ever. There will come
   a time when Americans will realise that the only thing wrong with black
   people is that they think something is wrong with black people. There
   will come a time when racist ideas will no longer obstruct us from
   seeing the complete and utter abnormality of racial disparities.

   There will come a time when we will love humanity, when we will gain
   the courage to fight for an equitable society for our beloved humanity,
   knowing, intelligently, that when we fight for humanity, we are
   fighting for ourselves. There will come a time. Maybe, just maybe, that
   time is now.
