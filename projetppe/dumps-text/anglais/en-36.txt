   The impact of COVID-19 has been disproportionately felt by populations
   experiencing structural racial- and ethnicity-based discrimination.
   Here, we describe opportunities for COVID-19 response and recovery
   efforts to help build more equal and resilient societies, through
   investments in: (i) interventions focused on explicitly addressing
   racial and ethnicity-based discrimination; (ii) interventions
   supporting the delivery of universal services, and in ways that address
   compounding and intersecting drivers of exclusion and marginalization;
   and (iii) cross-cutting enabling measures, such as participatory
   mechanisms and data disaggregation.

   More than two years since the first SARS-CoV-2 infections were
   reported, the COVID-19 pandemic remains an acute global
   emergency^[73]1. While many countries have successfully vaccinated
   significant portions of their populations, stark global inequities
   remain with imbalance in the global distribution of
   vaccines^[74]2,[75]3, and potential new variants could further threaten
   the ability of governments to recover from the inter-connected health,
   economic, and broader human rights crises. Within countries, the impact
   of COVID-19 has been disproportionately felt by populations
   experiencing structural racial- and ethnicity-based discrimination.
   Indeed, where disaggregated epidemiologic data are available, COVID-19
   morbidity and mortality rates are often significantly higher among
   people of African descent, indigenous peoples, and ethnic groups or
   other minoritized groups experiencing discrimination^[76]4,[77]5,[78]6.
   This reflects what social epidemiologists have long recognized: disease
   distribution is patterned by structures of disadvantage, inequality,
   marginalization and discrimination that often have historical roots and
   still have present-day manifestations^[79]7. Importantly, "race" is
   purely a social construct that has no biological basis, and documented
   racial inequities are due to racism not genetics or biology.

   Ethnicity-based and racial discrimination intersects with other forms
   of exclusion based on income, occupation, gender identity and
   expression, sexual orientation, disability, religion or belief,
   language, migratory status, rural/urban status and more, and is
   unlikely to exist in only one sector. Beyond health inequities,
   COVID-19 racial and ethnicity-based inequities have been documented
   across employment, education, housing and food insecurity, among other
   domains^[80]8. There are different pathways - from differential
   exposure, to inequitable access to health services, to uneven
   socioeconomic impacts of control measures, that can be further studied
   to inform policymaking, planning and programming^[81]9. Yet, these
   unequal impacts and human rights violations are not inevitable; neither
   is a spike in xenophobia and hate speech^[82]10.

   As countries work to respond to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and
   address both health challenges and broader socio-economic impacts,
   attention must be given to tackling racial and ethnic discrimination.
   With this in mind, and consistent with the UN Secretary General's Call
   to Action for Human Rights^[83]11, members of the United Nations
   Sustainable Development Group released a report on opportunities to
   address racial- and ethnicity-based discrimination^[84]12.

   The report was developed through a consultative process that began in
   late 2020 through early 2021, involving UN senior executives and
   technical staff, civil society, public health practitioners and human
   rights experts. It identified three strategic approaches to addressing
   racial and ethnicity-based discrimination in COVID-19 response and
   recovery efforts. These are: (i) interventions explicitly tackling
   racial and ethnicity-based discrimination, including improving
   anti-discrimination and redress mechanisms; (ii) interventions
   supporting the delivery of universal services, but in ways that address
   compounding and intersecting drivers of social exclusion and draw on
   the framework of proportionate universalism^[85]13; and (iii)
   investments in cross-cutting enabling measures, such as participatory
   mechanisms and data disaggregation (see Table [86]1 which is replicated
   from the report).
   Table 1 Summary of potential entry points to address racial- and
   ethnicity-based discrimination, replicated from UN report.
   [87]Full size table

   While not exhaustive and recognizing that entry-points would need to be
   tailored to national circumstances and developed in consultation with
   impacted communities, these mutually reinforcing entry-points together
   offer a framework to address discrimination directly through targeted
   measures, and indirectly through universal measures that will have
   amplified impacts on disadvantaged populations. This framework is
   currently being used in a capacity-building programme for United
   Nations Country Teams to support national policies and programmes that
   result in more just, equal and resilient societies. To date, thirteen
   UN Country Teams have participated in the programme and a
   training-of-trainers is planned for late 2022 to reach more, under the
   umbrella of the UN Network on addressing Racial Discrimination and the
   Protection of Minorities.

Explicitly tackle racial and ethnicity-based discrimination

   COVID-19 made clear that there is a need for explicit policies to
   tackle racial and ethnicity-based discrimination in the immediate term,
   to address current pressing needs, and in the long term. The
   longstanding impact of colonialism, theft of land, resources and
   exclusionary actions, for example, left indigenous peoples more
   vulnerable to COVID-19. Indigenous peoples already faced numerous
   obstacles to equitably accessing health services, including because of
   geographical barriers posed by the organization of provider networks,
   difficulty affording medical care, or difficulties in accessing
   culturally appropriate care that is in their own language and that
   respects their cultural beliefs, traditions and practices^[88]14.
   During the COVID-19 pandemic the world also witnessed a rise in
   episodes of xenophobia, hate speech, abuses, assaults, harassment,
   scapegoating, stigmatization and increase in excessive immigration
   control measures^[89]15.

   Countries can use this opportunity of heightened sensitivity to health
   inequities to adopt or strengthen existing anti-discrimination laws and
   policies that align with international human rights standards. These
   should extend beyond health care to address discrimination in the
   workplace, housing, education, law enforcement and border control
   sectors, among others. States must meet their obligations to respect,
   protect and fulfill the rights of everyone guaranteed under the
   International Convention on the Elimination of all Forms of Racial
   Discrimination by, for example, equipping existing autonomous national
   institutions to guarantee protection, effective implementation of
   anti-discrimination laws and policies, and access to justice for
   individual or collective complaints.

   Accurate communications and public messages centered on solidarity,
   tolerance, and inclusion are needed to combat scapegoating, `othering'
   or victim-blaming narratives that continue to exacerbate harm. Just as
   with past epidemics which have often resulted in human rights abuses
   and discriminatory enforcement of public health measures, as well as
   segregationist public health strategies^[90]16, concerns were raised
   around emergency measures inappropriately targeting groups, including
   migrants, refugees and asylum seekers, and the excessive and selective
   use of police and military for enforcement^[91]17. For example,
   longstanding anti-Roma racism in Europe, including violent and targeted
   oppression over centuries, resurfaced through inflammatory rhetoric and
   scapegoating during COVID-19^[92]18.

Addressing compounding and intersecting drivers of exclusion

   COVID-19 made inequities experienced by persons facing ethnicity-based
   and racial discrimination more visible, but unfair and discriminatory
   practices in education, housing, labor markets, the criminal justice
   system, to name a few, are often overlapping and compounding, and did
   not emerge simply as a result of the pandemic. Universal and
   rights-based strategies such as temporary moratoria on
   evictions^[93]19, expanded social protection nets, enhanced labor
   protections including for workers in the informal economy, expansion of
   free Wi-Fi and open education resources, release and decarceration
   efforts - among other measures - can have a differential positive
   impact on populations experiencing racial and ethnicity-based
   discrimination. This is because structural racism acts to skew
   distributions such that excluded and marginalized groups are
   over-represented among those working in the informal economy, those
   facing housing insecurity, those deprived of education, those living in
   poverty and those facing obstacles to justice. An intersectional
   analysis to comprehensively address the multiple and overlapping
   structural drivers of inequality, for example with regards to gender
   identity, religion, ableness, or citizenship status, in addition to
   race and ethnicity, is essential in COVID-19 recovery plans.

   Place-based strategies^[94]20, including neighborhood and
   community-based interventions, can similarly help mitigate the
   disproportionate impact of COVID-19 in geographic regions that have
   historically been underserved and contain large numbers of people that
   may have experienced racial and ethnicity-based discrimination. For
   example, investments in infrastructure, including health
   infrastructure, can help to ensure basic minimum needs for shelter,
   health, water, sanitation and hygiene are being met during and
   following the pandemic, while also generating employment opportunities
   in the immediate term for residents of underserved areas.

Invest in enabling and human rights-based approaches

   Although there are both direct and indirect strategies through which
   plans to build forward better from the COVID-19 pandemic can begin to
   address structural racism and ethnicity-based discrimination, as
   described above, these actions will only be successful if they address
   power inequities and are developed through participatory and inclusive
   approaches, ensuring historically excluded communities have
   decision-making power and adequate resources. COVID-19 response and
   recovery plans could earmark resources for civil society organizations
   working to address discrimination, social exclusion and human rights.

   In the immediate term, investments in systems to disaggregate data by
   race and/or ethnicity, as well as other dimensions that can help
   address the intersectional impact on particular groups, are needed. It
   is essential that these are accompanied by investments in data
   protection. These investments and other equity analysis tools can help
   unpack inequalities across groups both as a direct result of COVID-19
   and because of unevenly distributed impacts of pandemic-related
   measures and uneven socioeconomic consequences. Importantly, mechanisms
   for transparent data reporting that allow for public accountability
   will be critical. In many contexts, investment in vital statistics and
   civil registration will also be needed, since the pandemic highlighted
   that many people in need of emergency social protection were unable to
   access benefits because they lacked proper identification^[95]21.
   Similarly, efforts should be made to ensure that the needs of those
   with precarious legal identity status are also met.

Conclusion

   Inequalities in who gets sick and who suffers long-term socioeconomic
   consequences during and following a pandemic are largely shaped by
   unequal political power dynamics and how societies structure their
   economies, laws and policies and broader governance mechanisms. This
   tragic pandemic has further shone the light on grave and historic
   injustices and inequalities, both within and across countries, and
   should be an impetus for countries to strengthen their efforts to
   address systemic racism and ethnicity-based discrimination. Lessons
   learned from the COVID-19 pandemic also include the importance of
   prevention and the high cost of inaction. Parallels can easily be drawn
   around the need for urgent and concerted action to address the climate
   emergency if we are to prevent the unnecessary and unequal health
   impact of climate change^[96]22. This opportunity should not be wasted.
