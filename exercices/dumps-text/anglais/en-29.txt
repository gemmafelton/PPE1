Introduction and summary

   America's legacy of segregation and racial discrimination--particularly
   in the area of housing--has made communities of color more vulnerable
   to the effects of climate change. People of color are more likely than
   white people to reside in low-income neighborhoods, which have fewer
   economic and political resources to prepare for and recover from
   natural disasters and address the risks posed by environmental
   hazards.[81]^1And while climate change affects all Americans,
   communities of color are disproportionately exposed and susceptible to
   environmental hazards and natural disasters compared with affluent and
   white communities.[82]^2

   Racial inequalities in homeownership, the racial wealth gap, and racial
   disparities in climate risks and exposure to environmental hazards
   require a robust federal policy response to dismantle decadeslong
   inequities and achieve a just and equitable society. Key to that
   response are Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac--the government-sponsored
   enterprises (GSEs)--which own or guarantee more than 60 percent of the
   nation's home mortgages, including more than half of single-family home
   mortgage loans.[83]^3 These two organizations are uniquely positioned
   to reduce the nation's racial homeownership and wealth gaps while
   promoting climate and environmental resilience in communities of
   color.[84]^4

   The GSEs--also known as the enterprises--can close racial housing and
   wealth gaps and address environmental racism by including climate risk
   and environmental justice considerations when designating areas that
   are underserved by mortgage lending and by prioritizing the types of
   investment activities that reverse decades of environmental racism and
   promote economic stability, natural disaster risk mitigation, and
   climate resilience. Following the Biden administration's
   recommendations, federal agencies throughout the entire policy spectrum
   have begun to respond to the challenges of climate change, which are
   deeply intertwined with racial inequities. Moreover, such inequalities
   have a substantial geographic component. Therefore, when addressing
   them, it is critical for policies to explicitly target underserved
   communities of color to reverse the decadeslong patterns of
   discriminatory practices and disinvestment.

   However, the GSEs find themselves in a serious dilemma. Congress
   requires them to promote access to mortgage credit in underserved
   markets, which are typically more vulnerable to climate risks.
   Meanwhile, the GSEs need to minimize their risk of losses due to
   climate change without further disadvantaging those communities.[87]^5
   For example, natural disasters that damage or destroy homes with
   mortgage loans held by the enterprises jeopardize borrowers' ability to
   make principal and interest payments on mortgage loans, often leading
   to an increase in delinquencies, default rates, and loan losses in the
   enterprises' books of business. In addition, the risks that climate
   change poses to the GSEs represent a severe challenge for the
   securitization of mortgages in low-income communities and communities
   of color.

   Amid an increased awareness of the risks that climate change poses to
   the nation's housing finance system, the Federal Housing Finance Agency
   (FHFA), which oversees the GSEs, recently committed to address climate
   change to ensure that its regulated entities account for
   climate-related risks and natural disasters while continuing to fulfill
   their missions. Such commitment represents a significant step forward
   to ensure greater access to equitable and sustainable homeownership and
   to account for the risks associated with climate change and natural
   disasters. However, these initiatives need to be enhanced through
   concrete and actionable strategies to boost resiliency to climate
   change while promoting sustainable homeownership in underserved
   communities of color.

   To ensure the GSEs fulfill their mission to support equitable and
   sustainable homeownership in underserved communities of color and
   simultaneously address the growing threat of climate change to the
   housing market--a threat that disproportionately affects communities of
   color--the Center for American Progress offers the following policy
   recommendations:
     * Include climate change and environmental justice considerations
       when setting affordable housing goals, benchmarks, and criteria.
       The FHFA should collect climate and environmental justice data to
       assess the risks of climate change and environmental hazards on
       communities of color. Race, climate, and environmental indicators
       should be key components when formulating location-based affordable
       housing goals in order to promote sustainable homeownership in
       communities of color.
     * Reorient market incentives in targeted communities to promote
       climate resilience and access to affordable housing options in
       safer areas. The FHFA should prioritize investment activities that
       reverse decades of environmental racism and promote economic
       stability, natural disaster risk mitigation, and climate resilience
       in underserved communities of color. At the same time, the GSEs
       should ensure that communities of color have access to affordable
       homeownership in safer areas.
     * Promote collaboration and alignment with other agencies. The FHFA
       should promote and support collaboration and alignment among
       different agencies' data collection and distribution, especially
       regarding the geographic targets set for the affordable housing
       goals.
     * Improve the distribution of climate-related costs and protect
       borrowers of color. The GSEs should partner with the Federal
       Housing Administration (FHA) to avoid shifting climate-related
       costs from the enterprises to the U.S. Department of Housing and
       Urban Development (HUD). In addition, the FHFA should spread the
       risk across the enterprises' entire portfolio rather than price it
       into individual loans.

Communities of color are on the front lines of climate and environmental
risks

   The United States is becoming increasingly diverse. Data from the 2020
   census reveal that the country's population of color is rapidly
   growing, whereas the white population is declining. As demographer
   William H. Frey puts it, racial and ethnic diversity is taking
   "different forms in different places."[88]^6 While Black people are
   concentrated in the South and spill into several urban areas in the
   North and parts of the West, the growing Hispanic population is largely
   concentrated in the Southwest as well in the Western part of the
   country. As a result, Hispanic populations routinely share
   neighborhoods with other nonwhite groups, including Black, Asian and
   Pacific Islander, and Native American populations. Racial and ethnic
   diversity is becoming more prevalent everywhere, both in the form of a
   high representation of one group or,[89]^7 increasingly, a high
   representation of two or more nonwhite groups.[90]^8 (see Figure 1)

   Despite the fact that people of color are projected to soon become the
   majority of the U.S. population, they still lag behind non-Hispanic
   white people in homeownership and in their ability to accumulate
   wealth. (see Figure 2)

   In addition to the disparities noted above, natural disasters pose
   unequal risks to communities of color. A report released in late 2021
   by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) shows that even
   though climate change affects all Americans, people of color and
   low-income people are disproportionately exposed to the highest impacts
   of climate change, including those associated with extreme temperatures
   and coastal and inland flooding.[105]^9 Systemic racism has socially
   and economically disadvantaged communities of color, making them more
   susceptible to environmental hazards and natural disasters than white
   communities.[106]^10 People of color are more likely than white people
   to reside in low-income neighborhoods that have fewer economic and
   political resources to prepare for and recover from natural disasters
   and address the risks that environmental hazards pose to their
   communities.[107]^11 (see Figure 3)

   The discriminatory policies and practices of the past played a
   significant role in the levels of vulnerability to environmental
   hazards and natural disasters that communities of color experience
   today. Historical redlining practices,[115]^12 restrictive covenants,
   slum-clearance projects, and the siting of affordable and subsidized
   housing have contributed to the concentration of people of color in
   disinvested neighborhoods that are more likely than other communities
   to feature outdated housing lacking adequate insulation, flood
   proofing, off-grid energy, and air conditioning.[116]^13 A 2021 study
   conducted by Redfin shows that homes located in formerly redlined areas
   are more likely to be at high risk of flooding than those located in
   nonredlined areas.[117]^14 Communities of color are more likely than
   white communities to reside in low-lying sites that are vulnerable to
   flooding, such as inland flood risk zones and coastal communities
   experiencing rising sea levels.[118]^15

   As the United States becomes increasingly diverse, natural disasters
   represent a growing threat to communities of color. The constant
   overexposure of these communities to environmental hazards and risks
   makes them even more vulnerable to climate-related natural disasters.
   Because residential patterns vary greatly by racial and ethnic
   group--and because some areas face elevated natural risks--some groups
   face a greater exposure to natural risk than others.[119]^16 These
   differences, which are quantified in Table 1 and illustrated in Figure
   4 through Figure 12, underscore the importance of the targeted policy
   responses recommended in this report.

   Of the nearly 2 million Americans residing in close proximity to sites
   that are vulnerable to flooding, the majority are people of
   color.[127]^17 However, official counts often underestimate the actual
   size of vulnerable populations living in the 100-year flood plain or in
   other areas at high risk of flooding, making preparedness and relief
   efforts particularly challenging.[128]^18 As Table 1 illustrates,
   census tracts at very high risk of hydrometeorological natural
   disasters such as hurricanes, coastal flooding, and riverine flooding
   are overrepresented by nonwhite racial and ethnic groups. Only 16
   percent of non-Hispanic white people reside in such areas, compared
   with 18 percent of Black people, 19 percent of Hispanic people, and 21
   percent of Native Americans. The geographic distribution of areas at
   high risk of exposure--particularly to hydrometeorological natural
   disasters--largely overlaps with the racial and ethnic distribution of
   U.S. residents. (see Figure 1 and Figure 4) Areas along the Gulf of
   Mexico and coastal Atlantic regions are especially vulnerable to
   hurricanes and coastal flooding. Black and Hispanic populations
   concentrated in such areas are particularly exposed to these types of
   natural disasters. The risk of riverine flooding, on the other hand, is
   more scattered throughout the country, although large pockets of risk
   can be found in the Midwest as well as in the Southwest and Pacific
   regions, particularly where large concentrations of Hispanic, Native
   American, and communities with a mix of two or more races are highly
   concentrated.

   Cities tend to invest more in flood protection in areas with higher
   incomes and property values, depriving low-income communities of color
   of critical flood mitigation.[136]^19 In addition, flood insurance
   premiums are often unaffordable for low-income homeowners of color,
   most of whom do not have the financial resources to make home repairs
   and address the impacts of severe weather events.[137]^20 Low-income
   households own only one-quarter of U.S. homes insured through the
   National Flood Insurance Program,[138]^21 a voluntary partnership
   between local communities and the federal government that is managed by
   the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) and allows property
   owners, renters, and businesses to buy federally backed flood insurance
   to recover from flood-related disasters.[139]^22 A 2019 investigation
   conducted by NPR indicates that federal aid was often allocated based
   on cost-benefits analyses that tended to benefit affluent non-Hispanic
   white communities more than low-income communities and communities of
   color who needed assistance the most.[140]^23 A related study conducted
   by Rice University and the University of Pittsburgh shows that after a
   natural disaster, affluent communities were more likely than low-income
   ones to receive more aid from FEMA, which has important implications
   for the perpetuation of wealth inequality.[141]^24

   Furthermore, a 2021 HUD investigation concerning the Texas General Land
   Office's design and operation of the Hurricane Harvey State Mitigation
   Competition concluded that the state of Texas discriminated based on
   race and national origin when distributing funds to affected
   neighborhoods.[142]^25 Specifically, Texas steered federal funds toward
   white affluent areas by utilizing two scoring criteria that
   substantially disadvantaged Black and Hispanic communities.[143]^26
   This sort of practice is compounded by exclusions that date back to Jim
   Crow laws that discriminated against Black people in legal matters in
   southern states. For example, in the South, more than one-third of
   Black-owned land is still passed down informally within families, often
   for generations, in a process known as "heirs' property." Without
   formal deeds, Black landowners are cut off from federal money,
   including those related to natural disasters.[144]^27

   The inequitable investments made to improve the climate resilience of
   structures in coastal cities often trigger climate gentrification and
   displacement, a process whereby affluent residents of areas at high
   risk of flooding or exposed to rising sea levels--usually in coastal
   cities such as Miami and New Orleans--relocate to safer higher ground,
   often in minority and low-income neighborhoods. This type of relocation
   spurs higher housing prices and eventually displaces longtime
   low-income residents.[145]^28

   People of color also tend to bear the brunt of extreme heat events and
   other climatological natural disasters.[146]^29 Land cover
   characteristics, limited greenspace, the density of buildings and
   structures, and heat-retaining construction materials all combine with
   increasing heat levels to produce what is known as the urban heat
   island effect--particularly in racially segregated areas.[147]^30
   According to data reported by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric
   Administration (NOAA), extreme heat waves represent the most serious
   weather-related threats to human health.[148]^31 Evidence shows that in
   all major urban areas across the nation, the urban heat island effect
   tends to be worse for people of color than for non-Hispanic white
   people and contributes to heat-related health disparities.[149]^32 Heat
   waves are particularly common throughout the Southeast and Midwest
   regions and in large urban areas on the East Coast that are
   characterized by large concentrations of Black people. (see Figure 5)
   Indeed, 22 percent of Black people reside in areas at high risk of
   climatological disasters, most commonly involving heat waves.

   Even though extreme heat waves represent the most common and often
   fatal climatological risk, other types of heat-related disasters are on
   the rise--including wildfires and droughts--that disproportionately
   affect communities of color. (see Figure 5) For example, a University
   of Washington study shows that communities of color and low-income
   communities are much more vulnerable to wildfires than white
   neighborhoods.[157]^33 Specifically, nonwhite communities are 50
   percentage points more vulnerable to wildfires than white
   communities.[158]^34 Although affluent white people are more likely to
   reside in close proximity to the areas at greatest risk of wildfires,
   low-income communities and communities of color are more vulnerable to
   wildfires for the following reasons:
     * They are less likely to be able to afford insurance and any
       mitigation services, such as tree trimming and brush removal.
     * They are more likely to reside in apartment buildings that are
       harder to escape if exits are congested.
     * They are more likely to rent their homes, making them ineligible
       for the federal assistance that typically helps homeowners rebuild
       their properties in the event of a wildfire.
     * They are less likely to own a private vehicle, and therefore may
       have more difficulty evacuating the area.
     * Non-English speakers may not receive or understand evacuation
       notifications in time.[159]^35

   Hispanic, Native American, and Asian American people who are found in
   large concentrations in the Pacific region and Southwest, as well as
   the Rocky Mountains region and Florida, are particularly vulnerable to
   wildfires. Meanwhile, droughts represent a grave threat to Indian
   Country and rural Hispanic communities.[160]^36 Thirty-two percent of
   Native Americans are highly exposed to severe climatological events,
   primarily droughts and wildfires. Native American communities are
   particularly vulnerable due to their lower average income level, as
   well as their history of forced displacement onto federal reservations,
   which placed many of these communities in areas at high risk of
   wildfire.[161]^37

   Decades of environmental racism and historically unequal exposure to
   environmental hazards have made communities of color more vulnerable to
   the risks of natural disasters and hamstrung their ability to respond
   and adapt to climate change.[162]^38 As discussed in a CAP report, "A
   CRA To Meet the Challenge of Climate Change: Advancing the Fight
   Against Environmental Racism," environmental racism is undeniably
   related to climate change because it determines the communities most
   likely to suffer from the consequences of activities that cause global
   warming.[163]^39 People of color are more exposed to pollution from all
   types of sources than white people.[164]^40 People of color are
   estimated to have an air pollution index that is 15 points higher than
   that of white people.[165]^41 Black people, in particular, are
   disproportionately more exposed than other racial and ethnic groups to
   large concentrations of ambient fine particulate air pollution
   (particulate matter 2.5)--the largest environmental cause of
   mortality.[166]^42

   Usually, the disproportionate exposure of people of color to air
   pollution and other pollutants is due to the close proximity of
   racially segregated neighborhoods to highways, industrial plants, and
   other sources of pollution.[167]^43 Areas with a high exposure to
   environmental hazards and risks such as air pollution, lead paint, and
   toxic facilities, among others, largely overlap with areas in which
   different people of color are overrepresented. (see Figure 6) There
   are, however, some geographic and racial variations in the exposure to
   specific types of pollutants. For example, while proximity to toxic
   sites is scattered throughout the U.S. territory and is particularly
   high in urban areas, exposure to air pollutants and lead is remarkably
   high in the Western part of the country, and exposure to respiratory
   hazards and airborne toxic cancer risks is particularly elevated in the
   Southeast region. Compared with non-Hispanic white people, virtually
   all nonwhite racial and ethnic groups are overrepresented in such
   areas. In particular, 41 percent of Black people, 50 percent of Asian
   Americans and Pacific Islanders, and 47 percent of Hispanics reside in
   very close proximity to traffic and toxic sites. Furthermore, more than
   50 percent of Hispanics, 46 percent of Asian Americans and Pacific
   Islanders, and 44 percent of Native Americans are highly exposed to air
   pollutants and lead. Finally, 23 percent of Black people and 21 percent
   of Hispanics are highly susceptible to airborne toxic cancer and
   respiratory hazard risks compared with 10 percent of non-Hispanic white
   people.

   The following sections of this report will discuss the risks that
   climate-related natural disasters pose to the GSEs and the implications
   for communities of color, followed by a series of policy
   recommendations. Specifically, the authors explore how the GSEs could
   contribute to reducing the racial and ethnic homeownership gap while
   simultaneously tackling the risks associated with climate change and
   environmental injustice discussed above.

The risks natural disasters pose to the GSEs and implications for communities
of color

   A trend of worsening hurricanes, wildfires, and floods have resulted in
   billions of dollars in climate-related property losses, particularly to
   homes built in areas that are prone to floods, wildfires, and extreme
   weather.[175]^44 Floods represent the most frequent and costliest
   natural disaster in the United States, resulting in billions of dollars
   of damage every year. Floods are worsening in many areas due to rising
   sea levels, changing weather patterns, and patterns of development that
   have placed homes in high-risk areas.[176]^45 Yet, not all homeowners
   have flood insurance coverage to protect them against losses from
   floods. Only about one-third of U.S. households residing in areas of
   high flood risk are covered by flood insurance.[177]^46

   Major natural disasters can discourage housing activity, such as
   housing construction and purchases. This can result in the
   deterioration of housing conditions in both the affected areas and
   those that are adjacent to them, with rippling negative effects on the
   volume of mortgage loan originations, home prices, rents, and property
   values.[178]^47As property values decrease, the mortgage obligations of
   homeowners residing in vulnerable areas remain fixed, potentially
   increasing negative equity rates and foreclosures. Furthermore, the
   decline of property values has eroded communities' tax bases and
   compromised funding for local municipal services and
   infrastructure.[179]^48 The result is a vicious cycle that can
   drastically reduce the ability of communities--especially low-income
   communities and communities of color--to prepare for and respond to
   natural disasters and rebuild or relocate in the aftermath of severe
   weather events. Extreme natural disasters may spur affluent families to
   move out of disaster-prone areas, leaving behind low-income families
   who do not have the resources to move away. Ultimately, these trends
   can decrease family income levels and increase poverty rates in areas
   hit by severe disasters.[180]^49

   Over the years, the GSEs have purchased and guaranteed a growing
   portion of mortgages for homes in or adjacent to flood plains despite
   the significant risk that floods pose to the housing market.[181]^50As
   a large portion of home mortgages guaranteed by the GSEs are tied to
   homes built in flood plains and areas susceptible to natural disasters,
   climate-related disasters represent a serious concern for the GSEs.
   Borrowers whose homes are damaged or destroyed by natural disasters may
   struggle to make principal and interest payments on their mortgage
   loans, which can lead to more delinquencies,[182]^51 higher default
   rates, and loan losses in the enterprises' books of business.

   Recent evidence shows that in the aftermath of natural disasters,
   mortgage lenders--due to a growing awareness of the risk of mortgage
   defaults posed by climate change-related disasters--are increasingly
   approving loans that can be sold to the GSEs for homes located in flood
   zones and other vulnerable areas. Lenders are thus getting these
   mortgages off their books and transferring climate risk to the
   enterprises and ultimately to U.S. taxpayers.[183]^52 This phenomenon
   is particularly noticeable in areas facing rising sea levels and
   increased flooding in the Southeast Atlantic and Gulf Coast of the
   United States.[184]^53

   CAP analysis of Home Mortgage Disclosure Act data shows that between
   2018 and 2020, the GSEs purchased more than half of single-family home
   loans in areas exposed to different types of natural disasters related
   to climate change. (see Table 2) In particular, throughout that period,
   Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac purchased 56 percent of loans tied to
   single-family properties highly exposed to either coastal flooding or
   wildfires, and they purchased 54 percent of loans in areas that are
   highly exposed to drought.

   The GSEs' ability to address the risks related to climate change has
   been constrained in part because they have no regulatory authority over
   lenders and servicers. According to the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading
   Commission, the GSEs have insufficient discretion to screen and price
   mortgages based on climate risk because they are limited by regulations
   guiding their underwriting activities.[192]^54 In 2019, for example,
   the enterprises guaranteed $6.88 trillion in mortgage loans, but they
   did not price climate risk into their guarantee fees.[193]^55 GSEs do
   not charge a premium that reflects climate risk, which may
   unintentionally encourage residential construction and homebuying in
   the very areas that are vulnerable to climate-related disasters,
   including pricey coastal areas.[194]^56

   To mitigate their risks and shift some of the costs of severe floods
   away from their books of business in the event of unforeseen natural
   disasters, the GSEs impose flood insurance requirements on lenders and
   servicers as a condition of purchasing and servicing loans secured by
   properties located in FEMA-designated special flood hazard areas
   (SFHAs).[195]^57 Nevertheless, several climate-induced damages may not
   be insurable,[196]^58 and it is usually difficult to assess future
   flood-related risks because of the increasing unpredictability of major
   natural disasters. It is challenging to accurately determine which
   properties may experience losses due to climate change-related severe
   events in the future. SFHA maps, in particular, are often outdated and
   do not accurately represent future levels of flood risk.[197]^59 Flood
   models developed by the First Street Foundation, a nonprofit research
   and technology group defining America's climate risks, indicate that
   the flood risk across the nation is much greater than indicated by
   federal government estimates.[198]^60 First Street Foundation estimates
   that 14.6 million properties--8.7 million more properties than in
   government estimates--are at risk of a 100-year flood--one with a 1
   percent chance to hit in any given year. FEMA flood plain maps do not
   reflect risks from all types of floods--including pluvial floods, those
   caused by extreme rainfall--particularly in urbanized areas with a lack
   of permeable surfaces.

   Properties that are located outside the demarcated 100-year flood zones
   and are exposed to heavy precipitation tend to represent a substantial
   portion of flood damage loss.[199]^61 The GSEs hold more than 60
   percent of mortgages on homes in areas outside the 100-year flood
   plain, and fewer homeowners are purchasing federally backed flood
   insurance.[200]^62 Ultimately, the enterprises remain responsible for
   the damaged homes, and taxpayers are left on the hook for mortgage
   defaults when these homes are severely damaged and homeowners are not
   current on flood insurance, cannot sustain repair costs, and are forced
   to abandon their homes.

   The risks that climate change poses to the GSEs represent a serious
   challenge for the securitization of mortgages in low-income communities
   and communities of color. If the GSEs charged higher fees to guarantee
   mortgages on homes located in flood plains, they would
   disproportionally affect low-income communities and communities of
   color that are particularly vulnerable to the effects of climate change
   due to decades of systemic environmental racism.[201]^63 By charging
   higher location-based fees, the enterprises would raise the cost of
   borrowing in underserved communities. In turn, higher borrowing costs
   and insurance premiums would discourage lending in those communities,
   depress home prices, and perpetuate decadeslong patterns of
   disinvestment. The GSEs find themselves in a serious dilemma: Congress
   requires them to promote access to mortgage credit in underserved
   markets, which in turn tend to be particularly vulnerable to climate
   risks. At the same time, the GSEs need to minimize their risk of losses
   due to climate change without putting underserved communities at a
   further disadvantage.[202]^64

   Until recently, the GSEs have addressed climate risks predominantly
   within a disaster response and recovery framework,[203]^65 rather than
   proactively encouraging preparedness and resilience in at-risk
   communities. In 2021, however, the FHFA made a commitment to treat
   climate change impacts as a priority in its oversight of the GSEs and
   to ensure that its regulated entities account for climate-related risks
   and natural disasters while continuing to fulfill their mission to
   provide stability in the secondary market for residential mortgages and
   to promote access to mortgage credit in underserved markets.[204]^66
   Among the actions undertaken by the FHFA in the past two years is the
   addition of resiliency to climate risk as one of the assessment
   criteria in its 2022 scorecard for Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.[205]^67
   In addition, the strategic plan for fiscal years 2022-2026[206]^68
   explicitly addresses climate change as one of the main objectives.
   Specifically, the FHFA states that it will "identify options for
   incorporating climate change into regulated entity governance."

   To accomplish this mission, the FHFA will:
    1. "Conduct research on the risks of climate change on the housing
       finance system, including research specifically analyzing the risks
       and effects for underserved populations."
    2. "Build on experiences with natural disaster response to ensure
       prioritization of climate change at FHFA and the regulated
       entities."
    3. "Improve climate data collection, analysis, and reporting."[207]^69

   To complement the initiatives outlined in the strategic plan, the FHFA
   also directed Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to draft equitable plans with
   the explicit goal of promoting equitable access to affordable and
   sustainable housing by reducing the disparities in racial and ethnic
   homeownership and reducing underinvestment or undervaluation in
   formerly redlined areas.[208]^70

   The equitable housing finance plans for 2022-2024 represent a step
   forward in addressing racial inequalities in access to homeownership.
   In their plans, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac recognize the
   disproportionate risks climate change poses to underserved communities
   of color. However, similar to the strategic plan, the equitable housing
   finance plans seem to emphasize the importance of analytics for
   understating the effects of climate change rather than offering
   concrete and actionable strategies to enhance resiliency to climate
   change while promoting sustainable homeownership in underserved
   communities.[209]^71

   The GSEs already have promising tools to better target underserved
   communities of color to reduce the racial homeownership gap and, at the
   same time, address environmental injustice and the increasing climate
   risk in these communities. Because of the geographic nature of racial
   disparities in homeownership, the racial wealth gap, and the
   disproportionate vulnerability that communities of color have to
   environmental hazards and climate-related disasters, the FHFA should
   direct the GSEs to fine-tune their geographic targeting of communities
   of color through a revision of the proposed single-family affordable
   housing goals, as discussed below.

The enterprises' affordable housing goals

   Congress requires the government-sponsored enterprises to promote
   access to mortgage credit in underserved markets by meeting explicit
   affordable housing goals.[210]^72 The affordable housing goals are
   designed to encourage ongoing assistance to the secondary market for
   conforming home mortgage loans, in particular those for low- and
   moderate-income borrowers. The goals are specified in terms of total
   units financed by GSE purchases in three specific segments of the
   mortgage market: (see Table 3)
    1. Low-income borrowers
    2. Very low-income borrowers
    3. Borrowers in low-income areas

   With the exception of the third goal, which mentions a minority
   presence in geographically targeted areas, the affordable housing goals
   have continued to be based predominantly on economic factors.
   Furthermore, although the third goal explicitly addresses minority
   status, the goals have never distinguished among the racial and ethnic
   groups that make up minority neighborhoods.

   The designation of affordable housing goals has changed periodically
   based on the performance and efforts of the GSEs in achieving the
   targets in previous years.[211]^73 In August 2021, the FHFA announced
   new changes to the current goals to ensure the GSEs responsibly promote
   equitable access to fair and sustainable mortgage financing that
   explicitly reaches communities of color and other underserved
   populations. Specifically, the FHFA has proposed two new single-family
   home purchase subgoals to replace the existing low-income areas
   subgoal. One new subgoal targets minority communities; the other
   continues to target low-income neighborhoods.[212]^74 (see Table 3)

   The new designations of location-based underserved markets clearly do a
   better job including communities of color than older definitions,
   especially from a geographic perspective. (see Figure 7) The proposed
   underserved areas, particularly in the minority census tracts subgoal,
   cover areas characterized by larger percentages of nonwhite racial and
   ethnic groups than the current underserved areas specified in the
   current third goal, especially regarding Black and Hispanic people.
   (see Table 4) Had the proposed new subgoals been effective in the past
   three years, there would have been a clear improvement in targeting
   underserved communities of color and disadvantaged communities. For
   example, had the proposed subgoal one been effective from 2018 to 2020,
   the GSEs would have purchased loans in census tracts in which 63
   percent of the population consists of people of color--a much larger
   percentage compared with that of underserved census tracts targeted by
   current goal three. Census tracts targeted by proposed subgoals one and
   two would have been characterized by lower median household income
   levels and would have included larger percentages of households with a
   housing cost burden and people below 200 percent of the federal poverty
   line.

   No indicators or considerations related to environmental justice and
   climate change are currently included in the criteria adopted for the
   delineation of underserved areas to guide the GSEs in meeting their
   location-based affordable housing goals--even though climate risks, in
   the form of high heat and flood risk, are clearly greater in
   geographically targeted areas. Table 5 illustrates the importance of
   including climate change and environmental justice in the formulation
   of the geographically targeted affordable housing goals. Specifically,
   it shows the percentage distribution of GSE-purchased single-family
   home mortgage loans across areas that are highly exposed to
   climate-related natural disasters and environmental risks and hazards
   in current and proposed targeted underserved communities and in other
   income-based goals. If the proposed geographic location-based subgoals
   had been in effect for the past three years, a smaller percentage of
   loans would have been purchased by the GSEs in areas classified as
   minority census tracts (subgoal one) and low-income census tracts
   (subgoal two), which are characterized by a very high exposure to
   climate-related risks, high expected annual losses, high social
   vulnerability, and low community resilience. At the same time, the
   percentage of loans purchased in proposed location-based targets with
   high exposure to environmental hazards and risks and a high energy
   burden would have been larger than in current location- and
   income-based affordable housing goals. While reducing their activities
   in communities of color at high risk of natural disasters, the GSEs are
   likely to contribute to the long-standing disproportionate exposure of
   these communities to environmental hazards.

   These findings lead to an important policy prescription related to the
   GSEs' commitment to reducing the racial homeownership gap while
   addressing climate and environmental risks in communities of color.
   When promoting affordable homeownership in communities of color, it is
   critical that the GSEs not contribute to the already high exposure of
   these communities to environmental risks and make sure that communities
   of color at high risk of natural disasters are not left behind.

Policy recommendations

   To boost the FHFA's capacity to reduce the racial homeownership gap
   while simultaneously addressing climate change-related risks and
   systemic environmental racism reflected in the disproportionate
   vulnerability of communities of color to environmental hazards, CAP
   offers the following broad recommendations.

Include climate change and environmental justice considerations when setting
affordable housing goals, benchmarks, and criteria

   The FHFA should collect climate and environmental justice data to
   assess the risks posed by climate change and environmental hazards to
   communities of color. Race, climate, and environmental indicators
   should be a key component when formulating location-based affordable
   housing goals. Fine-tuning geographic targets would help the GSEs
   understand what specific activities enhance mitigation, promote
   equitably managed retreat from at-risk areas, and boost investment and
   climate resilience where they are needed the most. As this report has
   discussed, there are important variations in the exposure to climate
   and environmental risks for nonwhite racial and ethnic groups depending
   on the areas where they tend to be overrepresented. For example, while
   some groups are more exposed to hydrometeorological disasters, others
   are more vulnerable to climatological hazards. Furthermore, while some
   groups are more exposed to toxic facilities, others are more vulnerable
   to particulate matter, ozone, and other air pollutants that have
   deleterious public health consequences. Most importantly, the
   widespread, disproportionate proximity of communities of color to
   environmental hazards--due to decades of environmental racism--should
   be explicitly addressed to achieve environmental justice and make these
   communities more prepared and resilient in the event of natural
   disasters. Understanding variations in exposure to specific risks would
   provide guidance on the types of activities that should be
   incentivized.

Reorient market incentives in targeted communities to promote climate
resilience and access to affordable housing options in safer areas

   In addition to targeting communities of color that are vulnerable to
   climate change and environmental risks, the FHFA should prioritize the
   types of investment activities that reverse decades of environmental
   racism and promote economic stability, natural disaster risk
   mitigation, and climate resilience in underserved communities of color.
   This effort must be done without placing additional financial burdens
   on individual homeowners and communities. For instance, the FHFA should
   incentivize lenders and housing providers to encourage the development
   of energy-efficient and climate-resilient homes, including through
   electrification, solar power, and other sources of clean energy that
   reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Energy-efficient homes at high risk of
   heat waves would benefit vulnerable communities. In addition, new
   development and new mortgages in high-risk areas should be limited to
   reduce exposure to natural disasters, toxic facilities, and other
   environmental hazards. At the same time, the GSEs should ensure that
   communities of color have access to affordable homeownership in safer
   areas. To do so, the GSEs could enhance the availability of affordable
   homes in low-risk areas by offering incentives and resources, such as
   discounted rates for homes that are elevated or meet specific building
   and energy efficiency standards. Promoting the managed retreat of
   disadvantaged communities of color by steering them to low-risk areas
   is only possible if affordable and safe homeownership opportunities are
   available in those areas. At the same time, the GSEs should provide
   incentives in high-risk areas to foster physical adaptation and better
   protect homes.

Promote collaboration and alignment with other agencies

   The collection of climate data from multiple sources and coordination
   and consultations with other agencies and stakeholders is of paramount
   importance for assessing climate risk in communities of color, as well
   as for stress testing, scenario analysis, and geographic targeting. The
   FHFA should promote and support collaboration and alignment among
   different agencies in data collection and distribution, especially
   regarding the geographic targets defined for the affordable housing
   goals. The FHFA should align data-collection strategies and climate
   risk disclosure with the EPA,[241]^75 FEMA,[242]^76 NOAA, the U.S.
   Geological Survey, NASA, the financial regulators overseeing the
   Community Reinvestment Act,[243]^77 and the Council on Environmental
   Quality,[244]^78 as well as other sources of proprietary data such as
   the First Street Foundation,[245]^79 among others.

Improve the distribution of climate-related costs and protect borrowers of
color

   The GSEs should partner with the FHA to avoid shifting climate-related
   costs from the enterprises to HUD. For example, if the GSEs purchased
   the mortgages of borrowers of color in predominantly low-risk areas, a
   serious risk would arise for the FHA: It would unintentionally force
   the agency to bear the risks and costs associated with properties
   located in the more at-risk areas. In addition, the FHFA should spread
   climate risk across the enterprises' entire portfolio, rather than
   price it into individual loans, at the disadvantage of low- and
   moderate-income borrowers and borrowers of color who would otherwise
   continue to be priced out of areas at lower climate risk. At the same
   time, the FHFA should support fair lending and protect consumers from
   predatory and costly practices, possibly in collaboration with the
   Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.

Conclusion

   Decadeslong inequities in homeownership, the racial wealth gap, and
   exposure to climate risks and environmental hazards require a robust
   set of initiatives across the entire policy spectrum to achieve a just
   and equitable society. The GSEs are in a unique position to reduce the
   racial homeownership and wealth gaps in the nation while promoting
   climate resilience and environmental justice in communities of color
   without creating a modern form of redlining.[246]^80 They can do so by
   including climate risk and environmental justice considerations in the
   designation of underserved communities of color and by prioritizing the
   types of investment activities that reverse decades of environmental
   racism, promote economic stability, establish natural disaster risk
   mitigation, and create climate resilience in these communities.

       important heat-mitigating factor, are more likely to be found in
       parcels of owner-occupied housing. Because of decades of mortgage

       exposure to heat. See Nik Heynen, Harold A. Perkins, and Parama

       and Atmospheric Administration's National Centers for Environmental
       Information, the United States has experienced 323 weather and
       climate disasters with damages reaching or exceeding $1 billion
       from 1980 to 2021. In 2020 and 2021 alone, 42 severe disasters cost
       the nation a total of $257 billion in damages. See National Centers

   45. Kousky and Wiley, "Improving the Post-Flood Financial Resilience of
       Lower-Income Households through Insurance."
   46. Ibid. The mandatory purchase requirement for flood insurance,
       established by the Flood Disaster Protection Act of 1973, still
       applies only to homeowners with federally backed mortgages residing
       in properties located in special flood hazard areas delineated by
       FEMA as part of the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP). These
       include loans purchased by the GSEs as well as loans guaranteed and
       insured by Federal Housing Administration, U.S. Department of
       Agriculture, and U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs. The
       Biggert-Waters Flood Insurance Reform Act of 2012 and the Homeowner
       Flood Insurance Affordability Act of 2014 made some changes to the
       original legislation. For instance, lenders are required to accept
       private flood insurance policies meeting specific criteria in order
       to satisfy the mandatory purchase requirement. See U.S. Government
       Accountability Office, "National Flood Insurance Program: Congress
       Should Consider Updating the Mandatory Purchase Requirement,"
       (Washington: 2021), available at
       [300]https://www.gao.gov/assets/gao-21-578.pdf. The Government
       Accountability Office (GAO) report indicates that noncompliance is
       an important challenge not just for the enterprises but for the
       U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development as well. The
       requirement to purchase and maintain flood insurance does not apply
       to all properties such as, for example, those located in a special
       flood hazard area but without a mortgage loan. Also, it does not
       apply to lenders that do not issue federally backed mortgage loans.
       According to the GAO, "Community participation in NFIP is
       voluntary. However, for a community's residents to purchase flood
       insurance through the program, the community must participate by
       agreeing to enforce regulations for land use, building standards,
       and new construction in special flood hazard areas. Participating
       communities must also adopt and enforce state and community flood
       plain management regulations to reduce future flood damage." U.S.
       Government Accountability Office, "National Flood Insurance
       Program: Congress Should Consider Updating the Mandatory Purchase
       Requirement," pp. 6-7. The NFIP program faces serious challenges,
       such as the large amount of debt due to insufficient premium rates.
       The program is insolvent after having paid out more than it
       collected for several years. See Colman and O'Donnell, "Borrowed
       time: Climate change threatens U.S. mortgage market." Since 2004,
       in particular, the NFIP has been unable to cover all claims with
       premiums it had collected and had to borrow funds from the U.S.
       Department of the Treasury. The NFIP's troubles were further
       exacerbated by the severity of major natural disasters such as
       Hurricane Katrina and Superstorm Sandy, which resulted in
       catastrophic losses.
