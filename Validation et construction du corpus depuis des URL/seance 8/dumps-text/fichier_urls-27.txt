   Rapporteur Underscores Almost Complete Failure to Mainstream Minority
   Rights at United Nations

   A lack of political will leaves minorities and the disadvantaged
   particularly vulnerable to human rights violations, the Third Committee
   (Social, Humanitarian and Cultural) heard today, as experts called on
   Member States to protect minority, cultural, physical and mental
   health, safe drinking water and albino rights.

   Briefing the committee, Fernand De Varennes, Special Rapporteur on
   minority issues, highlighted the almost complete failure to mainstream
   minority rights at the United Nations, despite the Secretary-General’s
   guidance note on the subject in 2013. Pointing to examples of rights
   violations in India, the United States and China, he noted that
   minorities represent more than three quarters of the world’s stateless,
   are the most educationally disadvantaged and are politically excluded.

   He stressed that the mostly forgotten Plan of Action suggested by the
   Secretary-General in 2013 must be revived and a permanent forum on
   minorities established at the United Nations. Unless the Organization
   gives them a focus, the international community will continue to
   witness increases in statelessness, hate speech on social media and
   violence against minorities worldwide, he said.

   In the ensuing interactive dialogue, delegates condemned human rights
   abuses in each other’s countries, with delegates from Iran and Syria
   expressing concern over the United States’ racist treatment of African
   Americans.The Russian Federation accused the United Nations of focusing
   too much on indigenous and Afro-descendant minorities, while Poland
   condemned the Russian Federation’s misuse of minority rights as a
   pretext to violate territorial integrity in its aggression in Ukraine.

   Addressing the right to health, Tlaleng Mofokeng, Special Rapporteur on
   the right of everyone to the enjoyment of the highest attainable
   standard of physical and mental health, highlighted the impact of
   racism on human dignity, life, and the right to control one’s health
   and body. Pointing to the legacy of apartheid, slavery and
   colonization, she said racism linked to poverty leads to high rates of
   police brutality, poor access to justice and recourse, mass
   incarceration, and a lack of access to housing, education, employment,
   and healthy food.

   Delegates shared the Special Rapporteur’s concern in the ensuing
   interactive dialogue, with the representatives of China and Cuba
   addressing systemic racism and roadblocks to health care African
   Americans face in the United States.The representative of the Joint
   United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS) stressed that the
   economic crisis following the COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in a rise
   in new HIV infections in many countries, pointing to a need for
   race-informed prevention policies.

   Also briefing the Committee were the Independent Expert on the
   enjoyment of human rights by persons with albinism, Muluka-Anne
   Miti-Drummond, Independent Expert on human rights and international
   solidarity Obiora C. Okafor, Special Rapporteur on the human rights to
   safe drinking water and sanitation, Pedro Arrojo-Agudo, and Special
   Rapporteur in the field of cultural rights, Alexandra Xanthaki.

   The Committee also continued its general debate on human rights today,
   with delegates expressing concern about human rights violations in
   Ukraine, Myanmar, China, United States, Afghanistan, Canada, Iran,
   Syria, Democratic People’s Republic of Korea and others.Delegates from
   conflict countries outlined successes in dealing with human rights
   abuses, calling for international dialogue and cooperation in combating
   such heinous acts.

   Speaking in the general debate were representatives of Fiji, Pakistan,
   Ethiopia, Bahrain, Nicaragua, United States, Iran, Brazil, Yemen,
   Japan, Estonia, Côte d’Ivoire, Bangladesh, Costa Rica, Iceland,
   Indonesia, Azerbaijan, Kiribati, Egypt, Albania, Germany, United
   Republic of Tanzania and Portugal.

   Also speaking in exercise of the right of reply were representatives of
   Saudi Arabia, Cuba and China.

   The Third Committee (Social, Humanitarian and Cultural) will reconvene
   at 10 a.m. on Friday, 21 October, to continue its discussion on the
   promotion and protection of human rights.

   Interactive Dialogue: Minority Issues

   FERNAND DE VARENNES, Special Rapporteur on minority issues, highlighted
   the almost complete failure to mainstream minority rights at the United
   Nations, despite the Secretary-General’s guidance note on the subject
   in 2013.He underscored that minorities are facing threats of exclusion,
   discrimination and even calls for genocide on a massive scale. Pointing
   to regression on recognition of minority human rights, he cited the
   possible denial of citizenship for millions of Bengali and other
   minorities in Assam India, voting restrictions and subsequent
   disenfranchisement of millions of minorities of the right to vote in
   the United States, and allegations of crimes against humanity against
   the Uyghur and Turkic minorities in Xinjiang, China.While initiatives
   for other marginalized or vulnerable groups have proliferated, there
   have been no major institutional initiatives for the protection of
   minority rights, he said, which in turn engenders a reluctance to
   acknowledge that minorities are disproportionately targeted by
   increased levels of hate speech, incitement to violence, scapegoating
   and bigotry.

   Mminorities represent more than three quarters of the world’s
   stateless, the most educationally disadvantaged and often the most
   politically excluded, he said.They are the main targets of hate speech
   in social media, which is only increasing, he said, adding that they
   are not always protected by the rule of law.Worse, while perpetrators
   may operate with impunity, victims and human rights defenders
   themselves are prosecuted, while politicians of the majority
   instrumentalize fear against minorities for short-term political gains,
   he said.Minorities’ grievances are often at the root of internal
   conflicts, he added, calling on the international community to address
   the massive violations of minorities’ human rights, lest the world
   continue to face increasing instability and conflict.

   He recommended that the Action Plan to operationalize the
   Secretary-General’s 2013 guidance note be put in place to mainstream
   minority rights across all pillars and initiatives, such as the Rabat
   Plan of Action and Beirut Declaration, as well as all United Nations
   agencies.He also noted that the Forum on Minority Issues has called for
   the United Nations to produce a minorities’ treaty to establish
   international cooperation in a climate where minorities are seeing
   their cultures and the use of their languages stifled, and practice of
   religion restricted.

   The representative of the United States welcomed the Special
   Rapporteur’s report, lauding him for the ongoing dialogue in his
   country to end racial discrimination.He asked how countries can work
   together to address cross-cutting and intersectional issues faced by
   members of minority groups and marginalized communities.

   Meanwhile, Iran’s representative expressed deep concern about Mr. De
   Varennes’ findings in the United States, adding that hate crimes have
   risen to a 10-year high in the country.She also asked how the
   international community can tackle hate speech and racism against
   Muslims in European Member States.

   Echoing his colleague, the representative of Syria denounced the racist
   treatment of African Americans and Latinos in the United States.

   The representative of the Russian Federation said the United Nations is
   focusing more on afro-descendant, refugee, sexual minorities and
   others, while national minorities remain outside its scope of
   vision.Adding that the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner
   for Refugees (UNHCR) is biased, she drew attention to continued banning
   of national minorities’ native languages in Baltic States.

   The representative of Poland, aligning with the European Union,
   condemned the use of minority rights as a pretext to violate
   territorial integrity, as exemplified by the Russian aggression in
   Ukraine.She added that the Russian Federation’s brutal oppression
   targets Crimean Tatars particularly, who have struggled for identity
   since the annexation of Crimea in 2014.

   The representative of Cameroon, noting that minorities include
   indigenous persons and people of African descent, asked to what extent
   their concerns are considered and what mechanisms might protect their
   rights.

   The representative of Pakistan noted a surge in Islamophobia and raised
   concern over anti-hijab laws, pogroms and calls for genocide against
   Muslim minorities in India.He cited the public flogging of Muslim men
   in Gujarat as an example.

   To counter, the representative of India condemned the false accusations
   by Pakistan, highlighting crimes against Christians and Hindus in that
   nation.Affirming that India is a multi-religious, multi-ethnic
   republic, he expressed disappointment that references to statelessness
   in the Rapporteur’s report are entwined with minority rights.

   Also speaking in the interactive dialogue were representatives of
   Liechtentstein, Austria, Switzerland, Slovenia, China, Democratic
   People’s Republic of Korea, Maldives, and the European Union, speaking
   in its capacity as observer.An observer of the Sovereign Order of Malta
   also spoke.

   In his response, Mr. De Varennes called on States to begin discussing a
   global treaty instrument defining minority rights internationally.He
   reiterated that the mostly forgotten Plan of Action suggested by the
   Secretary-General’s in 2013 must be revived.Addressing the question on
   the suitability of a permanent forum for minority rights, he said that
   forming one is applicable to any group giving a voice to those who are
   the most marginalized.Unless the United Nations gives them a focus, the
   international community will continue to witness increases in
   statelessness, hate speech on social media and violence against
   minorities worldwide, he said.Sharing successes, he highlighted
   Austria’s South Tirol region, where public services and employment are
   offered in German, multilingual and multicultural practices in Canada,
   the multireligious society of Singapore, and practices in Mexico,
   Bolivia, Mauritius, and Finland.Human rights of minorities have been
   put into practice in interesting and effective ways, he said, adding
   that it is now time to clearly address some of the worst human rights
   violations.

   Interactive Dialogue:Cultural Rights

   ALEXANDRA XANTHAKI, Special Rapporteur in the field of cultural rights,
   noted that that “cultural rights are the big absentee from development
   discussions priorities, programmes and structures” and are in fact
   sidelined or even violated globally.Pointing to the development of the
   Barbuda Ocean Beach Club in the Bahamas, she underscored the
   detrimental impact it has on the cultural rights of the local
   population.Referring to reports alleging that in the Ngorongoro
   conservation area of the United Republic of Tanzania, there are plans
   for relocation, forced evictions, home demolitions and additional
   restrictions, which will have affected no less than 82,000 people by
   2027; she said that the Masai and local people were never adequately
   consulted.This damages their cultural rights to maintain, exercise and
   transmit a way of life as well as their understanding of nature
   conservation, she said. In addition, over the years, her mandate has
   joined communications concerning the construction of hydroelectric dams
   and oil pipelines in several countries, including Malaysia, Canada and
   Turkey.While States’ answers varied, meaningful consultation,
   participation of all concerned in decision-making processes and free,
   prior and informed consent of indigenous peoples were lacking, she
   underlined.The Latin Village in the United Kingdom, a market that has
   become a hub for Latin culture, could be destroyed in the name of urban
   regeneration, she said, adding that domestic legislation has been
   unable to deal with cultural rights claims.She reminded States of their
   legal obligations to respect and protect the cultural rights of
   individuals and communities, including in development
   processes.Cultural rights must be included in discussions on
   development, she added, fully aligning with the aspirations, systems
   and world views ofindividuals and groups most likely to be affected.She
   encouraged consultations with and participation of individuals and
   communities in all phases of development.

   The representative of the United Republic of Tanzania, addressing the
   Special Rapporteur’s mention of a risk of eviction in the Ngorongoro
   Conservation Area, said “it is more of a perception than a reality”, as
   “there is no fear of eviction, no planned eviction and there has been
   no eviction”. Adding that the report does not identify specific
   conservation measures by the Government to cause such a fear, he
   pointed to the East African Court of Justice’s judgement of 30
   September 2022, in which the issue of eviction was refuted.

   The representative of the European Union, in its capacity as observer,
   asked how the Special Rapporteur envisages a strengthened role for the
   cultural sector in post conflict situations.She asked about the
   character and functioning of the proposed interagency platform
   measuring the contribution of culture to the achievement of the
   Sustainable Development Goals as well as interaction between this
   platform and the United Nations Sustainable Development Knowledge
   Platform.

   The representative of the United States pointed to Moscow’s destruction
   of cultural heritage sites in Ukraine and cultural rights violations
   within the Russian Federation against artists who don’t support the
   war.He also noted the repression of minority groups by China in
   Xinjiang, as well as andthat country’s interference in Tibetan
   identity. In addition, he expressed concern for mass detentions based
   on ethnicity in Ethiopia, exclusion of women in Afghanistan, and the
   detention and discrimination against Rohingya in Burma.He asked the
   Rapporteur what tools are available to protect the cultural rights
   endangered by aggressor States’ policies.

   The representative of Cuba, notingg that today coincides with his
   country’s national culture day, stressed his State’s efforts to protect
   cultural heritage and ensure cultural development.He defined the
   economic blockage as an obstacle to cultural development, hampering
   cultural exchanges.He asked the Rapporteur to explore the impact of
   unilateral coercive measures, like the United States blockade on Cuba,
   on the enjoyment of cultural rights.

   The representative of Poland focused on theeradication of cultural
   identity of local populations caused by intentional actions perpetrated
   in the context of internal instability and armed conflicts. She
   condemned land grabbing, forced displacement, and resettlements and the
   damage to 204 cultural heritage sites due to the Russian Federation’s
   invasion of Ukraine.She also pointed to the deterioration of human
   rights in Belarus, which is affecting national minorities, including
   the Polish one.She asked how States can ensure better protection of
   cultural rights of persons in armed conflicts to preserve heritage and
   ensure development of local populations.

   The representative of Pakistan stressed violations for political and
   ideological reasons, including in one country of his region, where the
   rights of 200 million Muslims and people in the occupied territories
   have been violated.The aim is to obliterate Islamic heritage, impose
   majoritarian supremacist ideology and justify the occupation of the
   disputed territory of Jammu and Kashmir, he said.He asked what options
   there are, including international legal instruments, to protect the
   cultural heritage of minority populations.

   The representative of Türkiye expressed regret that comprehensive
   efforts by her country to conserve cultural heritage are not correctly
   reflected in the report.She said the Ilisu Dam project should not be
   regarded solely as an economic development project, as it has provided
   a series of benefits to local people.She detailed the resettlement plan
   regarding the Hasankeyf district, stating she will provide further
   information to the Rapporteur.

   The representative of China said that delegations of the United States
   and other Western countries have been abusing the interactive dialogue
   of the Third Committee by referring to the Xiangjian report of
   OHCHR.Such States have submitted a draft decision on the report, which
   most States in the Human Rights Council voted against, she added,
   stressing that human rights are being used to interfere in the domestic
   affairs of other countries. “Today it is about China, tomorrow it could
   be any other developing country,” she said.

   The representative of India, highlighting his country’s efforts to
   promote cultural rights through its national programmes, said it has
   ensured the extension of all progressive legislation to the territories
   of Jammu and Kashmir and resumed the pace of socioeconomic and cultural
   development. “The residents enjoy more freedom and fundamental rights
   since all union laws now apply there,” he said. Asking about the impact
   of the COVID‑19 pandemic on cultural sectors’ contribution to
   sustainable development, he condemned the abuse of a United Nations
   platform yet again by Pakistan to propagate false and malicious
   propaganda against his country.

   The representative of the United Nations Educational, Scientific and
   Cultural Organization (UNESCO), pointing to work promoting a
   rights-based approach to culture, emphasized the importance of the
   Mondiacult conference.In its declaration, 150 States recognized for the
   first time culture as a global public good, she said, asking the
   Rapporteur what is needed to ensure greater policy investment from
   respective organizations in the area of cultural rights.

   Responding, Ms. XANTHAKI said that the whole idea of human rights is
   aimed at discussing and assessing human rights situations, adding that
   politicizing the dialogue does not help the mandates.Rejecting the “one
   size fits all” approach, she said development can’t have a top-down
   approach, calling for the inclusion of all in the State’s vision of
   development.Adding that no new legislation is needed to enhance human
   rights, she said strong binding documents exist, but it is necessary to
   encourage their implementation and include cultural rights in
   development policies.Further, she called for active, continuous and
   informed consultation with individuals and communities in all phases of
   development.“We can stand together to address the visibility gap that
   exists in cultural rights,” she said.She invited States to answer her
   mandate’s communication and use all the tools available to send
   information, including by requesting visits to their countries.

   Also speaking in the dialogue were the representatives of Portugal,
   Algeria, Cameroon and Nigeria.

   Interactive Dialogue: Albinism

   MULUKA-ANNE MITI-DRUMMOND, Independent Expert on the Enjoyment of Human
   Rights by Persons with Albinism, presented her report (A/77/199) on the
   human rights challenges experienced by persons with albinism on the
   move, which include migrants, refugees, asylum seekers, migrant workers
   and internally displaced or trafficked persons.Last year, the Office of
   the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees reported that around
   89.3 million people worldwide were forcibly displaced due to
   persecution and conflict, she recalled, noting that persons with
   albinism are among those affected, although little information is known
   about them as persons on the move.While they are also considered
   persons with disabilities due to visual impairment and their high
   susceptibility to skin cancer, the data relating to persons with
   disabilities on the move are not disaggregated to better reflect the
   situation of those with albinism.

   Identifying the main drivers for mobility for persons with albinism,
   she said continued attacks or fear of being attacked in several African
   countries have led them to seek asylum in different countries.However,
   not only attacks but also stigma and discrimination, manifested through
   cruel and inhuman treatment, cause persons with albinism to find more
   inclusive societies.Better access to health services serves as a driver
   for migration, especially for those with skin cancer and persons with
   rarer forms of albinism, such as Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome, which
   requires a lung transplant.In addition, climate change has caused
   persons with albinism to move to areas where they are not exposed to
   sunny climates, where the risk of skin cancer is higher.

   Despite a growing number of cases of persons with albinism successfully
   claiming asylum based on the well-founded fear of being persecuted due
   to their membership of a particular social group, many still struggle
   with the process.Authorities who oversee these processes often do not
   have sufficient knowledge about albinism, she said, raising concern
   over the extreme challenges that people with albinism experience,
   particularly in the context of attacks and pervasive discrimination
   they are fleeing from.Interviews with persons with albinism in refugee
   camps uncovered a lack of access to critical health services and
   products such as sunscreen, she cautioned, adding that continuous
   exposure to the sun in the Africa region is life-threatening.She also
   observed a lack of psychosocial support, as well as discrimination,
   bullying and attacks in refugee camps.

   Highlighting good practices, she pointed to the specific reference to
   persons with albinism in the framework guiding the European Union
   Asylum Support Agency, which recognizes that persons with albinism are
   members of a particular social group that suffer from persecution for
   asylum purposes.The United Nations refugee agency’s (UNHCR) Policy on
   Age, Gender and Diversity (2018) and its guidance on working with
   persons with disabilities in forced displacement as well as the African
   Union’s Plan of Action to end attacks and other human rights violations
   against persons with albinism (2021–2031) are also important tools for
   people with albinism.

   In the ensuring interactive dialogue, the representative of the United
   Republic of Tanzania rejected the reference in Ms. Miti-Drummond’s
   report to the 10,000 people with albinism that have been displaced or
   relocated, as it was based on a research paper published in 2017.In
   five years, much has changed, he said, urging the expert to update her
   sources.Since 2016, there has been no single report on a killing or
   violence committed against persons with albinism in the United Republic
   of Tanzania, he asserted.

   The representative of Nigeria said her Government never condones any
   form of discrimination against persons with albinism and remains
   committed to ensuring equal opportunities for all.Moreover, Nigeria has
   adopted a national policy on albinism as well as the Plan of Action to
   End Attacks and Other Human Rights Violations Targeting Persons with
   Albinism in Africa (2021-2031).She asked the expert about ways to gain
   greater support from the international community to protect persons
   with albinism from all forms of attacks and guarantee their access to
   justice.

   The representative of South Africa called for the eradication of hate
   crimes committed against persons with albinism on the move, in
   particular refugees and asylum seekers, underscoring her country’s
   commitment to full inclusiveness of the rights of all persons with
   disabilities in social, economic, and political life.She asked the
   expert about ways to ensure that accounts of persons with albinism are
   accurately recorded, considering the lack of disaggregated data.

   The representative of the European Union, speaking in its capacity as
   observer, echoed Ms. Miti-Drummond’s concern over intersecting forms of
   discrimination that persons with albinism face, including migrants,
   refugees, and internally displaced persons with albinism.Highlighting
   the intersection of albinism and gender, she cautioned that women and
   girls with albinism in camps can be vulnerable to sexual harassment.She
   asked the expert about ways to further the dialogue with relevant
   stakeholders, including civil society representatives, on addressing
   key human rights concerns for persons with albinism.

   Responding to the delegate of the United Republic of Tanzania, Ms.
   MITI-DRUMMOND said that the number of displaced persons is still
   relevant.She underscored the importance of increasing the capacity and
   knowledge of officials, including immigration officials, on
   albinism.She detailed specific health needs for persons with albinism
   relating to skin cancer, including sunscreen protection.Voicing concern
   over the failure to include persons with albinism in the development of
   policies that will lead to their continued indivisibility, she noted
   that the numbers of persons with albinism are highly underestimated.
   Calling on States to ensure data collecting mechanisms, she cautioned
   that persons with albinism are often subjected to trafficking with the
   purpose of exploitation, particularly the removal of body parts for
   their use in ritual practices.She also underlined that persons with
   albinism fall into the category of persons with disabilities.

   Also speaking was the representative of China.

   General Debate Statements

   BAE JONGIN (Republic of Korea) expressed concern over the humanitarian
   situations in Myanmar and Afghanistan as well as the Russian
   Federation’s indiscriminate shelling in Ukraine and the worsening
   situation in the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea.Citing unjust
   punishments such as a “shoot to kill” policy in the latter country, he
   drew attention to the 2020 “Reactionary Thought and Culture
   Denunciation Law”, which punishes anyone distributing media content
   from the Republic of Korea with prison or the death penalty.While their
   northern neighbour suffers from food insecurity, the military
   nonetheless has used 40 ballistic missiles in violation of Security
   Council resolutions, he added.He welcomed the appointment of a Special
   Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in the Democratic People’s
   Republic of Korea, calling on that country to resume dialogue to
   facilitate reunions of separated families as well as begin a
   constructive dialogue on abductees and prisoners or war.

   PATRICIA CHAND (Fiji) reiterated her Government’s commitment to
   advocate for the rights of vulnerable groups, including persons with
   disabilities, children, women, the elderly, persons of a different
   sexual orientation, migrant works and indigenous peoples.She
   highlighted the particular situations of climate refugees and climate
   induced internally displaced persons, warning that the rights of
   peoples in the frontlines of climate change are threatened like never
   before.Climate change has exacerbated the decline in protections of
   human rights of individuals and communities displaced or living in
   situations of extreme climate distress.Climate change is driving a
   widening inequality between the Global North and Global South, she
   stressed, pointing to a growing climate-debt burden that harms the
   enjoyment of economic, social, and cultural rights.

   MUHAMMAD RASHID (Pakistan) stressed the need to counter disinformation
   and protect human rights through international cooperation.To this end,
   he urged the international community to establisht institutional
   arrangements on interactions between States, media, and other
   stakeholders as well as an international plan of action to fight
   disinformation online and offline in both the public and private
   domain.He stressed the importance of digital awareness, outlining the
   need to develop uniform rules and regulations for social media business
   companies.Among the most repugnant manifestations of disinformation is
   the State-sponsored campaign of disinformation promoted by the
   Government of India to serve its strategic and ideological objectives,
   he noted, adding that such disinformation is used systematically to
   justify the 70-year-old suppression of the Kashmiri people.

   YOSEPH KASSAYE YOSEPH (Ethiopia) said his country has worked tirelessly
   for years to protect migrants and minorities through its Constitution,
   reforms, greater transparency, balance and a larger political space.He
   added that citizens formerly classified as terrorists now participate
   in society and prisoners are treated with dignity.Progress has been
   impeded by challenges, he added, as the war in northern Ethiopia
   continues to impact citizens, who are victims of killing, looting and
   destruction of property.Affirming the Government’s commitment to ensure
   accountability through continued work with the appropriate United
   Nations agencies, he also decried politicization of human rights and
   the continual failure of the Human Rights Council to uphold its
   mission.Recalling that his country rejected the establishment of the
   International Commission of Human Rights Experts on Ethiopia, as its
   establishment was politically motivated, he noted that the Commission
   submitted a report with unsubstantiated allegations nonetheless.

   Mr. QAMBAR (Bahrain) noted that women’s participation in her country’s
   economic development has increased to 43 per cent of the total
   workforce, with 35 per cent in the private sector, 55 per cent in the
   public sector and 47 per cent in entrepreneurship.During the COVID‑19
   pandemic, Bahrain provided free examinations to all citizens and
   residents with no discrimination, she said, along with a $12 billion
   fiscal economic package to support individuals and affected
   sectors.Reaffirming cooperation and commitment of human rights
   protection at the international level, she pointed to the upcoming
   parliamentary elections as a landmark event to help establish democracy
   in the country.

   CARLOS ERNESTO MORALES DÁVILA (Nicaragua), associating with the Central
   American Integration System, described the restoration of the right to
   health as well as the right to education as his Government’s
   priority.To this end, he highlighted the national plan to combat
   poverty.Based on the national plan of production and consumption,
   Nicaragua has produced 95 per cent of the food consumed by its citizens
   and achieved food sovereignty for its population.The Government of
   Nicaragua continues to protect the environment and build its strategy
   to mitigate the effects of climate change on the principle of common
   but differentiated responsibility.He pointed to important progress in
   the energy matrix, increasing electricity coverage at the national
   level, including from renewable sources.He also rejected unilateral
   illegal sanctions imposed by some States.

   STEPHEN DOUGLAS BUNCH (United States) condemned the Russian
   Federation’s war in Ukraine, stating that the invasion is a test to
   determine whether all Member States will uphold the United Nations
   Charter.She called on the Russian Federation to end its aggression as
   well as its war crimes and filtration operations in Ukraine, which
   result in torture, killings and the separation of children from their
   families.Turning to China, he said it is perpetrating a genocide in
   Xinjiang, severely repressing Tibetans, and cracking down on human
   rights in Hong Kong.Highlighting the worsening situation in Syria and
   use of violence against peaceful protestors in Iran, she condemned the
   death of the Irani, Mahsa Amini, in police custody.She also condemned
   the use of laws to target and censor activists in Egypt, Saudi Arabia,
   Tajikistan and Turkmenistan.

   FATEMEH ARAB BAFRANI (Iran) said human rights mechanisms should deal
   with systematic violations of human rights, including those that breach
   the right to development and the right to self-determination of
   sovereign States. “It is regretful that the systematic apartheid of the
   Israeli regime combined with raids, occupation, colonization,
   intimidation and the unlawful and inhuman siege continues unabated,
   with the unconditioned support of the United States and other Western
   countries,” she said, noting that “millions of Palestinians continue to
   live in despair in their homeland”.Further, she pointed to grave human
   rights violations by the United States against minorities as well as
   that country’s use of inhuman economic sanctions.She pointed to
   Canada’s actions against indigenous peoples as well as hate crimes and
   hate speech against minorities, particularly Muslims. Similarly, she
   said that discrimination based on religion, race and ethnicity has been
   rising in several European countries, with episodes of the Koran being
   burned.Noting that some of these countries are a haven for terrorist
   groups, she stressed the need for legal obligations either to extradite
   or prosecute alleged terrorists.She urged States to review the Special
   Rapporteur’s report on unilateral coercive measures to assess the grave
   violation of Iranian human rights derived from such practices imposed
   by the United States.Stating that it is critical to safeguard the
   United Nations human rights machinery from politicization and double
   standards, she rejected allegations against recent developments in her
   country.

   ELAINE CRISTINA PEREIRA GOMES (Brazil) emphasized that her Government
   has significantly improved its database on persons with disabilities
   and created a national disability information system based on official
   data aimed at monitoring policies in this area.In this context, she
   pointed to the active participation of Brazil on the Committee on the
   Rights of Persons with Disabilities.Freedom of expression and belief
   are embedded in Brazil’s Constitution, she noted, voicing concern over
   a new wave of religious stigma, racism, and xenophobia against
   minorities and vulnerable groups that has emerged worldwide in the
   context of the pandemic.Reiterating her country’s commitment to
   promoting freedom of speech as well as religious freedom for people of
   every religion, she expressed deep concern over the recent rise of
   antisemitism.She also stressed that her Government has issued hundreds
   of humanitarian visas to those fleeing humanitarian crises.

   ALI MABKHOT SALEM BALOBAID (Yemen) said his Government will continue to
   cooperate with the National Committee to verify human rights as well as
   relevant instruments.He urged the international community to increase
   its support for the the High Commissioner on Human Rights so the Third
   Committee can complete its work. Under the six-month truce in his
   country, the Government was able to welcome ships in all Yemeni ports,
   althought Houthi terrorism continues to undermine peace.They plant
   mines, kidnap and reject the truce, he lamented.Detailing further
   attacks against a judge, bogus trials, torture and repression of free
   speech, he called on the international community to take a stance
   obliging the Houthis to implement the 2016 decision to assure Yemeni
   development.

   MAGOSAKI KAORU (Japan) said that the Russian Federation’s aggression
   against Ukraine constitutes a serious violation of international law
   prohibiting the use of force, undermining the very foundation of the
   international order.Condemning it as unacceptable, he called on the
   Russian Federation to fully comply with its obligation to respect
   international law, including international humanitarian and human
   rights law.Deploring the executions of Myanmar detainees, he reiterated
   calls to the Myanmar Armed Forces to take concrete actions to
   immediately stop violence, release the detainees, and quickly restore
   the democratic political system.Referring to the report on the human
   rights situation in the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region, he urged
   China to take further positive and concrete actions, including by
   providing transparent explanations.Describing abductions by the
   Democratic People’s Republic of Korea as a serious problem affecting
   the sovereignty of Japan and the lives and safety of the people, he
   urged the former country to realize the immediate return of all
   abductees. Further, he expressed concerns about the situation in Iran,
   where the protests following the death of Mahsa Amini have resulted in
   numerous deaths and casualties.

   REIN TAMMSAAR (Estonia), associating with the European Union, said the
   lives of millions of Ukrainians were scarred forever when Moscow
   launched a full-scale war.Since then, a trail of war crimes and mass
   graves has been left behind by the Russian Federation on occupied
   Ukrainian territories, much like the atrocities Nazi and Soviet regimes
   conducted against innocent civilians during the twentieth century.In
   September, the International Commission of Inquiry concluded that
   Russian forces have committed war crimes in Ukraine.Civilians have been
   subjected to gender-based and conflict-related sexual violence,
   children have been forcibly deported to the Russian Federation and many
   have been illegally detained, tortured or have gone missing.Moreover,
   Moscow’s war efforts also exacerbate the global food crisis and food
   security challenges, he noted.He acknowledged the brave women and girls
   of Iran and Afghanistan for standing up for their basic human rights.He
   brought attention to the deteriorating situation of Belarus, where the
   human rights of civilians are being systematically violated with
   impunity.

   KOUADJO MICHEL KOUAKOU (Côte d’Ivoire) said that the current situation,
   characterized by armed conflicts and humanitarian and migratory crises,
   negatively impacts a State’s ability to guarantee the full enjoyment of
   human rights.Stressing the need to continue efforts to promote human
   rights, particularly for women and children, as well as human rights
   defenders, he commended the commitment of the human rights system to
   build a universal architecture for their protection.He pointed to his
   country’s commitment at the national and international level in this
   regard.Measures taken include the ratification of all key international
   legal instruments on human rights, establishment of the National Human
   Rights Council in 2018, a law to protect human right defenders, and
   efforts to reinforce the prevention system.

   Interactive Dialogue: International Solidarity

   OBIORA C. OKAFOR, Independent Expert on human rights and international
   solidarity, turning to his report on global vaccine solidarity, said
   the world’s response to the COVID‑19 pandemic has only highlighted the
   great disparity between the Global North and Global South, stressing
   that a huge gap remains in the number of vaccines allocated to the
   Global South and what those countries have received.

   Some pharmaceutical companies charge between 6 and 24 times the
   production cost of their vaccines, as States with the resources to pay
   set the benchmark for pricing, he said.While this makes it difficult
   for States with less purchasing power to pay for them, even the COVAX
   initiative pays up to five times more than cost per dose.This expense
   has resulted in countries either waiting to vaccinate until subsidized
   rates became available or diverting national resources from other
   important budgets to purchase vaccines.Further, while many wealthy
   States contributed large sums of money to the COVAX facility, they also
   undermined its effectiveness — which delays the end of the pandemic for
   all — through nationalism and their own needs.Misinformation has only
   exacerbated challenges by undermining trust in public institutions and
   vaccines themselves, he added.

   Despite challenges, he commended the large vaccine donations through
   multilateral initiatives such as COVAX and also bilateral agreements
   between States, he said, adding that of the 12 billion doses of
   vaccines needed to vaccinate 20 per cent of the world population, the
   COVAX initiative has secured 2.8billion, though that number falls short
   of World Health Organization (WHO) projections needed to vaccinate as
   least 70 per cent of the African population.He called for more global
   and regional solidarity in closing the North-South inequality gap.The
   ongoing failure on the part of States to ensure optimal global vaccine
   solidarity is clearly contrary to the values of international
   solidarity, he said.

   In the interactive dialogue, delegates stressed the need for
   international solidarity in responding to crises such as that posed by
   the COVID-19 pandemic, with many spotlighting the adverse effects of
   unilateral coercive measures and expressing regret that calls for
   vaccines be treated as global public goods went unheeded.

   The representative of Azerbaijan, speaking for the Non-Aligned
   Movement, underlined the fundamental, historical value of international
   solidarity and human rights.During the Movement’s 2019 summit in Baku,
   Heads of State and Government affirmed that, if any member of the
   Movement suffers harm — economic, political or military — the Movement
   will express solidarity with the affected State through the provision
   of material, political or other forms of assistance.She also rejected
   all unilateral coercive measures, including those used to put political
   pressure on any country — particularly developing States.

   The representative of Cuba said the global response to the COVID‑19
   pandemic laid bare structural problems inherent in the current
   international order, and that a serious gap separates the Global North
   from the South in accessing resources necessary to achieve human
   rights.Developing countries’ level of access to COVID‑19 vaccines is
   unacceptable and demonstrates that the current international order is
   obsolete, as it serves to proliferate poverty in the Global South. A
   more just, equitable and inclusive international order is needed and,
   for this to occur, countries must cease imposing unilateral coercive
   measures, such as the United States’ economic blockade against Cuba.He
   then asked for Mr. Okafor’s view on such measures’ impact on access to
   COVID‑19 vaccines.

   The representative of Venezuela said that vaccine nationalism and
   pharmaceutical monopolies have resulted in competition that allowed the
   most-privileged to access COVID‑19 vaccines, rather than the
   most-vulnerable.The international cry for vaccines to be treated as
   public goods was not heeded, and some actors used the pandemic for
   political ends, which included the illegal imposition of unilateral
   coercive measures.He asked Mr. Okafor how best to contribute to a
   worldwide campaign against unilateral coercive measures, and about the
   possibility of a United Nations declaration on international
   solidarity.

   The representative of Algeria underlined the need for international
   solidarity in relations between countries, especially in times of
   crisis such as that caused by the COVID‑19 pandemic.The pandemic
   demonstrated inequalities in development and a rise in nationalism and
   protectionist practices, especially in the case of vaccines.While some
   countries are in full recovery, others continue to struggle.Noting that
   only 19 per cent of Africa’s population has been vaccinated, he
   observed that the call for vaccines to become a global public good was
   not heeded.He expressed hope that the international community can avoid
   the same mistakes in the future and demonstrate increased solidary to
   overcome common challenges.He asked Mr. Okafor how transparency in
   medicine prices can be ensured, and how Trade-Related Aspects of
   Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPs) can be used to allow the local
   production of vaccines.

   The representative of Cameroon, associating herself with the
   Non-Aligned Movement, encouraged public assistance for development,
   noting that vaccine nationalism and other forces are hindering
   countries’ efforts in this regard.She asked Mr. Okafor about the level
   of State support for a proposal to allow all States to manufacture
   COVID‑19 vaccines without being subject to certain
   intellectual-property restrictions; if the request to declare vaccines
   global public goods fostered international solidarity in the health
   sector; and to what extent international solidarity is affected by
   TRIPs, not only in the context of COVID‑19, but also for technology
   transfer as a whole.

   The representative of the Russian Federation said that the COVID‑19
   pandemic laid bare the need to link collective efforts to carry out
   comprehensive measures to tackle such challenges.The international
   community must assist the hardest-hit countries, and also eschew trade
   wars and the imposition of unilateral coercive measures.The Russian
   Federation stands ready to cooperate with all countries on
   epidemiological security, she said, detailing her country’s efforts to
   assist others in responding to COVID-19.She also pointed out that,
   unlike Western vaccine producers, Russian manufacturers not only
   exported finished drugs, but also established local production abroad
   in a transparent, non-discriminatory fashion to ensure universal access
   to COVID-19 vaccines.

   The representative of Iran underscored the need for States to join in
   solidarity to ensure equal access to COVID-19 vaccines.The vaccination
   process in Iran was hindered because of sanctions, she said, noting
   that the report does not mention the impact of unilateral coercive
   measures, which exacerbate vaccine-access challenges and, consequently,
   the right to life in certain countries.She asked Mr. Okafor if he
   planned to raise the issue of unilateral coercive measures in the
   future.

   The representative of China expressed concern over excessive vaccine
   stockpiles in some countries and the unfair global distribution of the
   same.For its part, China has promoted the fair distribution of
   vaccines, and its President has implemented initiatives relating to
   global vaccine cooperation and global development.She also expressed
   concern over the indiscriminate use of unilateral coercive measures by
   the United States and others that seriously hamper targeted countries’
   ability to obtain vaccines.Such measures artificially create
   humanitarian difficulties, she said, calling on all countries to
   safeguard the rights to life and health and reaffirm vaccines as global
   public goods to ensure their fair distribution.

   The representative of Costa Rica noted that his country has advocated,
   since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, that international
   solidarity is a necessary response and that health should be considered
   a global public good.In that vein, it has advanced a proposal in the
   WHO to create an access pool for COVID-19-related technology to
   facilitate the transfer and exchange of technology and good practices
   in the health sector.However, 39 per cent of the global population has
   yet to be fully vaccinated, and the WHO’s target of 70 per cent global
   vaccination by mid-2022 has been missed.He asked Mr. Okafor what could
   be done to reach this target in the short-term, and what lessons Member
   States and the United Nations system can learn from this situation to
   better prepare for the next pandemic.

   The observer for the Sovereign Order of Malta said that, during the
   COVID-19 pandemic, the international community learned the value of
   acting across borders and boundaries to provide support in the name of
   human rights.The international community must not allow fundamental
   human rights to be granted depending on location; rather, they must be
   upheld worldwide.“A threat to justice anywhere is a threat to justice
   everywhere,” she said, urging the application of extraterritorial
   jurisdiction to promote human rights across the globe.

   Mr. OKAFOR, responding, observed that a common theme among speakers was
   strong support for international solidarity and a deep awareness of its
   importance, especially in an emergency such as the one created by the
   COVID-19 pandemic.He also highlighted the realization that the
   international community must do better to prepare for the next
   pandemic, as “it is not about whether, it is about when” such an event
   will next occur.On the impact of unilateral coercive measures on access
   to COVID-19 vaccines, he said that this varies across countries but, in
   most cases, such measures inhibit access to such vaccines.He also
   agreed with speakers that health should be recognized as a global
   public good.Further, he emphasized that the international community
   must overcome the instinct to think of the world as arranged in
   “silos”, as viruses do not respect State boundaries.Rather, he urged
   that the world be thought of “as one sky”.

   Turning to a potential United Nations declaration on international
   solidarity, he noted his and others’ work on such an instrument, along
   with his intention to invite States to a stakeholders’ forum in Geneva
   in January 2023 to consider a proposed draft.However, States themselves
   must decide if such an initiative will move forward.On how to ensure
   transparency in the price of medicines, he said that the main problems
   to address are: practices that have driven up the price of medicine;
   the undermining of the COVID-19 Vaccines Global Access (COVAX)
   facility; and secret, direct dealings with pharmaceutical companies.On
   local vaccine production, he noted that such production has begun, but
   stressed that such products must be bought or production will be shut
   down.Turning to lessons learned, he underscored the need to strengthen
   international solidarity in all areas.“A mindset reset,” is essential,
   he added, as everything will flow from this.

   Interactive Dialogue:Physical and Mental Health

   TLALENG MOFOKENG, Special Rapporteur on the right of everyone to the
   enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of physical and mental
   health, presenting her report on racism and the right to health,
   highlighted the importance of anti-racist and anti-coloniality
   frameworks.As a Black woman from South Africa who has experienced
   apartheid and continues to live under the crushing weight of racism and
   the legacy of colonialism, she underscored the importance of focusing
   on the impact of racism on human dignity, life, non-discrimination, and
   the right to control one’s health and body.Her report spotlights the
   global health impact on racialized people of the living legacy of past
   and ongoing forms of racism, apartheid, slavery, and coloniality.It
   also sheds light on the impact of racism and discrimination on Black
   people, persons of African descent, migrants, and indigenous
   peoples.Describing residential segregation as a powerful predictor of
   health, she cautioned that communities predominantly composed of people
   of African descent are more exposed to environmental toxins, air
   pollutants and carcinogens, which contributes to higher rates of
   pulmonary diseases and lower birth weights.Being a migrant or holding a
   refugee status is also often a barrier to realizing the right to
   health, she noted.

   Her report further considers the impact of past and contemporary forms
   of racism on the right to health.Linked to poverty, racism leads to
   exceedingly high rates of police brutality, poor access to justice and
   recourse, mass incarceration, and a lack of access to housing,
   education, employment, and healthy food.Racism also leads to increased
   rates of mortality and morbidity.Her report identifies good practices
   for affirming the right to health care and provides examples of how to
   end racism and discrimination.She presented the concept of epistemic
   injustice — whereby someone’s knowledge or experience is not considered
   credible based on power and associated stereotypes — which has been
   applied in the context of health care.Voicing concern that many former
   colonized countries still carry the legacy of the European colonial
   regimes through their restrictive laws, such as those pertaining to
   abortion or criminalizing sex work, she pointed to countries in which
   the criminal legal system disproportionately polices women and girls of
   African descent.

   In the ensuing interactive dialogue, the representative of the European
   Union, in its capacity as observer, reiterated that health is a human
   right and access to effective vaccines, medicines, health technologies
   and therapies is an important dimension of this right.Acknowledging the
   impact of racism on access to health care, she stressed that the
   COVID‑19 pandemic has further highlighted the consequences of existing
   health inequalities suffered by people with a minority, racial or
   ethnic background.She asked the Special Rapporteur about the biggest
   barriers in the access to health care for people with a minority racial
   or ethnic background.

   The representative of Egypt pointed to several projects aimed at
   expanding universal health coverage and the response to COVID‑19 that
   have been implemented by his Government.All foreigners residing in
   Egypt enjoy the same health care available to Egyptian citizens, he
   noted.The report of the Special Rapporteur fails to highlight the
   importance of international cooperation, technology transfer and
   capacity-building; also, it does not reference the need to support
   developing countries in enhancing local and regional productions of
   health technologies to better their preparedness for future pandemics,
   he observed.

   Meanwhile, the representative of China voiced concern about deep-rooted
   racism in Washington’s judicial and law enforcement system as well as
   serious violations of the right to health of African Americans,
   especially women of African descent.Racism is a serious threat to the
   human rights of minorities in the United States, including the right to
   life and health, she underscored, adding that during the COVID‑19
   pandemic, Latinos and African Americans were three times more likely to
   be infected and two times more likely to die from the infection. From
   the COVID‑19 pandemic to the monkeypox epidemic, the problem of
   systematic racial discrimination against ethnic minorities in the
   United States has become increasingly evident, she asserted.

   The representative of Cuba, citing racism as a social factor that
   determines health, cautioned that the Afro-descendant population in the
   United States has been disproportionately affected by COVID‑19 in terms
   of access to vaccines and medical treatments.Voicing concern over the
   spiral of systemic racism which people of African descent suffer in the
   United States, he noted that instead of facing such challenges,
   Washington applies unilateral coercive measures, such as the financial
   blockade against Cuba, which violates the Charter of the United Nations
   and has a negative effect on the rights of Cuban people, in particular
   the right to health.He urged the Special Rapporteur to analyse the
   impact of such measures.

   The representative of the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS
   (UNAIDS) underlined that after a period characterized by economic
   crisis and the COVID-19 pandemic, HIV infections are rising rather than
   falling in many countries.Stressing the need to close inequalities,
   including those driven by racism, he asked what kinds of HIV policy
   shifts are suggested by a focus on racism as a driver of HIV and other
   pandemic diseases.

   Responding, Ms. Mofokeng raised concern over continued misinformation
   about vaccines that impact other diseases outside the COVID‑19
   pandemic.Many people are living under the crushing weight of multiple
   effects of discrimination that is enabled by racism, she underlined.She
   warned against the effect of universal coercive measures, especially in
   the context of COVID‑19, on health.The impact of COVID is
   disproportionate and racism continues to be a determinant in many
   settings, she acknowledged, also stressing that people have a right to
   a healthy working environment, including fair labour
   practices.Criminalization of poverty, sex work and same-sex relations
   often leads to further marginalization, she cautioned, stressing the
   importance of long-term funding to the United Nations system.

   Also speaking were representatives of the United States, Portugal,
   Brazil, and Algeria.

   Interactive Dialogue:Water and Sanitation

   PEDRO ARROJO-AGUDO, Special Rapporteur on the human rights to safe
   drinking water and sanitation, presenting his report (A/77/167), said
   that today 44 per cent of the world’s population is rural, including 80
   per cent of the 2 billion people without safe drinking water, two
   thirds of the nearly 4 billion without safe sanitation and 92 per cent
   of the 500 million who still defecate in the open.In the absence of
   public investment in basic infrastructure, communities are often
   supplied with untreated water from public sources, community-managed
   wells, private wells, vendors with tanker trucks, or directly from
   springs, rivers or lakes, he noted.He reported that the irruption of
   mining, hydroelectric, agricultural and industrial companies in their
   territories breaks the principle of availability due to
   overexploitation and contamination of their sources.The lack of
   infrastructure forces women and girls to seek water from distant
   sources, breaking the principle of accessibility, while extreme poverty
   breaks the principle of affordability.In addition, he spotlighted
   challenges in sanitation, including the lack of priority in public
   policies, cultural taboos, and lack of information, training and costs
   to ensure safe and decent sanitation.While community water management,
   typical of peasant cultures, offers the most positive examples to
   follow, like the 80,000 community aqueducts in Latin America serving 70
   million people in impoverished rural areas, peasant cultures are often
   weakened by the growing influence of private ownership, he said.“There
   is a need for rights-based legislation and budgetary commitments to
   strengthen rural community water and sanitation system,” he said,
   adding that rural municipalities are often subject to insufficient
   allocation of resources or even privatization of rural water
   management.Faced with the increasing risks of drought and flooding due
   to climate change, it is urgent to promote rural adaptation strategies
   that require not only public funding but also the active participation
   of communities, he emphasized.People’s legitimate opposition to
   projects like land-grabbing or the construction of large dams often
   leads to criminalization, repression and even the murder of community
   leaders, he underlined, stressing that Global Witness has recorded
   almost 2,000 such cases in the last decade.“The obligation of
   Governments to guarantee the human rights of rural communities to safe
   drinking water and sanitation cannot be excused by arguing scarcity
   problems,” he said, adding that “nor is it acceptable to argue a lack
   of economic resources when these human rights are not prioritized in
   public budgets”.

   The representative of Spain asked how the right to water and sanitation
   should be reflected in the 2023 Water Conference. Appreciating the
   gender approach of the report and urging women to participate more
   actively in resource management, she asked what Governments should do
   to favor the participation of women in community water institutions.

   The representative of Brazil said that land regularization and strict
   laws that counter land grabbing are crucial to protecting and promoting
   the right to safe drinking water and sanitation. Noting her country’s
   progress in land regularization, she stressed that between 2019 and
   2022, her Government issued over 362 rural property titles. Further,
   she said her country has one of the strictest set of environmental laws
   in the world. The Brazilian Forest code rules that rural producers must
   preserve up to 80 per cent of native vegetation on their lands,
   depending on the region. Permanent preservation areas located inside
   farms account for 25 per cent of all such areas in Brazil. She asked
   about best practices or innovative approaches for guaranteeing access
   to water and sanitation, particularly in Latin America and the
   Caribbean.

   The representative of Iceland stressed that safe access to water
   provides a foundation for gender equality and sustainable livelihoods.
   Noting that women and girls, especially those living in rural areas,
   are disproportionately affected by lack of access to quality water and
   sanitation, she said this has been part of her country’s contribution
   to development cooperation with partner countries. Discrimination
   norms, gender stereotypes, stigma and taboos related to menstruation
   and childbirth also affect the realization of the right to water and
   sanitation. Adding that women and girls in rural areas often bear the
   responsibility of ensuring sufficient water at home, often walking long
   distances, she underscored their vulnerability to climate change and
   sexual gender-based violence. She asked what more could be done to
   guarantee that women and girls, especially those living in rural areas,
   are included in decision-making.

   The representative of Egypt stressed her country’s efforts to reach the
   population with water infrastructure, desalination, water recycling,
   and cover canals to prevent evaporation of water in a country where
   such vital resources are rare. Noting that access to safe drinking
   water and sanitation requires access to water itself, she lauded
   international cooperation and solidarity when dealing with
   transboundary water.

   The representative of the Syria, highlighting drinking water,
   irrigation and sanitation, said his country has suffered great losses
   due to terrorist operations that target dams and other water
   infrastructure. When the European Investment Bank stopped financing
   water projects in Syria, material damages exceeded $2 billion, he said,
   adding that Türkiye is decreasing its agreed bilateral volume of water
   by half.Responding, Mr. Arrojo-Agudo stressing that 2 billion people
   are without safe drinking water and 4 billion without sanitation
   worldwide, said: “We are not facing a business opportunity but a
   democratic challenge.” He called on States to make peace with rivers
   and aquatic ecosystems, promoting new approaches to the democratic of
   management of water, as this “is a common good not a commodity”.
   Recognizing the role of women and girls in accessing water in the most
   impoverished communities, he said they may spend four hours a day to
   that end, time that they cannot invest in income generation, school or
   necessary rest. Further, he underscored menstrual hygiene as a part of
   the human right to water and sanitation, adding that Governments must
   secure legal titles for lands and water rights that communities have
   traditionally enjoyed.

   Turning to the inhabitability of territories due to climate change,
   where adaptation is not feasible, he underscored the need to apply
   resettlement plans to rural populations, guaranteeing their human
   rights with international agreements and financing. While the
   development of water projects is politically more profitable than
   cleaning polluted water, progress in guaranteeing this resource cannot
   be achieved without paying attention to sanitation first. He called
   next March’s Water Conference an “unprecedented event”, where the
   United Nations will meet with defenders of human rights, sanitation and
   drinking water.Also speaking in the dialogue were the representatives
   of Algeria, the United States and the United Republic of Tanzania. The
   representative of the European Union, in its capacity as observer, also
   spoke.

   General Debate Statements

   MUHAMMAD ABDUL MUHITH (Bangladesh) detailed visits to the country by
   Michelle Bachelet and future visits by other mandate holders in the
   coming months. Bangladesh has formulated a disaster management policy
   to safeguard the rights of all peoples in the context of climate
   change. Affirming the Government’s support for migrants and declaring a
   commitment to combat racism, xenophobia, and related intolerance, and
   to uphold human rights, he said the country’s experience of exclusion
   has inspired it to stand firm against all forms of racism and
   intolerance.Bangladesh opened its gates to the Rohingya when they were
   forced to flee their ancestral homes in Myanmar. He said that the
   country will continue its diplomatic efforts to secure human rights of
   the Rohingya.

   DANIEL ZAVALA PORRAS (Costa Rica), reiterating his country’s commitment
   to dignity and intrinsic human values, such as freedom, justice, and
   health, voiced concern over multiple interrelated challenges, including
   the COVID‑19 pandemic, the environmental crisis – the greatest threat
   to human rights - and conflicts.Faced with the magnitude of these
   challenges, Costa Rica has introduced strategies for eradicating
   poverty and discrimination.Highlighting the link between human rights
   and the environment, he stressed that Costa Rica will support all
   initiatives that provide solutions based on a human rights approach.He
   also noted that gender equality must be a priority for the
   international community. Stressing the importance of civil society
   organizations, he described scrutiny and accountability as a guarantee
   of inclusion and legitimacy.

   Ms. INGA VON ERNST (Iceland), noting that promoting human rights is a
   priority for her country both at home and abroad, stressed that such
   rights are universal.International cooperation is critical to
   implementing human rights for all, especially in the current context of
   climate change, a global pandemic and the tragedy of war returning to
   Europe.On that point, she underscored that the Russian Federation’s
   invasion of Ukraine is a blatant violation of international law.She
   went on to point out that many basic rights thought to be secure are
   now being challenged, spotlighting increasing religious intolerance;
   violent nationalism and racism; homophobia, transphobia and biphobia;
   hate speech; and a pushback on gains made in gender equality and
   women’s reproductive rights.She stressed the need to reverse these
   trends, to champion the values of democracy, freedom and human rights
   and to defend a system where dissent is an integral part of public
   discourse.

   Mr. PRIMASTO (Indonesia) underscored that his Government prioritizes
   protection of the civil, political, economic, social, and cultural
   rights of its customary law communities.While Indonesia is home to the
   largest Muslim population in the world, the right of citizens and
   residents to adhere and worship to other religions and beliefs,
   including native faiths, is guaranteed by the Constitution.In Indonesia
   today, native-faith followers can have their beliefs officially cited
   in the national identity register.He also stressed the importance of
   preserving ancestral languages, including access for children to
   learning them.

   BILLUR AHMADOVA (Azerbaijan) underlined her country’s commitment to the
   United Nations Charter since its admission 30 years ago. Stressing the
   importance of respect for territorial integrity, she said any issues
   related to China must be approached with this principle in mind. Adding
   that Azerbaijan is a party to many fundamental documents and treaties,
   she said her country is a multi-ethnic society that considers its
   diversity a richness. Emphasizing that hate propaganda and attempts to
   propagate false versions of history undermine identity, she decried the
   Armenian delegate’s intervention the previous day, which hinders
   ongoing dialogue between the two countries. Expressing concern about
   Armenia’s racist hate speech in public and political discourse,
   including in the media, she said that strengthening peace and security
   is only possible through adhering to international law.

   TEBURORO TITO (Kiribati), aligning with the Group of 77 and China,
   noted that his country’s Constitution promotes and safeguards
   fundamental rights and freedoms of the individual. He expressed concern
   about the increasing number of young people in Kiribati and elsewhere
   who are overly assertive about the legal rights and entitlements
   endowed upon them by human rights laws and instruments.However, they
   are not sufficiently enthusiastic about the duty and responsibility to
   respect other people and give back something to the families,
   communities and societies to which they belong, he said. Believing that
   this is the result of the disproportionate push on human rights laws
   without an accompanying push for one’s duty and responsibility to
   others, he invited the international community to address this
   imbalance urgently.

   HEBA MOSTAFA MOSTAFA RIZK (Egypt), spotlighting the problem of hate
   speech in the digital realm, urged countries to provide frameworks to
   uphold the human rights and safety of their societies.She also
   expressed concern over discrimination against Americans of Latin
   American and African descent, pointing out that the Guantanamo Bay
   detention camp is a symbol of massive human-rights violations.She went
   on to note that focusing on only one aspect of human rights can lead to
   fragmentation, and that the exclusion of certain people runs counter to
   the need to promote human rights for everyone.In this vein, she
   stressed that failing to ensure the right to development for all will
   lead to setbacks for the United Nations.

   ENIAN LAMCE (Albania) called for improving the human rights system,
   building more resilient societies and effective educational systems,
   and developing inclusive health systems able to provide services,
   including sexual and reproductive health.He stressed the importance of
   ensuring universal respect for human rights for all individuals without
   distinction, regardless of ethnicity, nationality, gender, age, and
   religion.Advocacy for human rights is meaningless without the
   participation of women and girls, he said, noting that special
   attention should be paid to women’s rights and gender equality,
   ensuring women and girls access to political and economic
   resources.Albania opposes the death penalty in all circumstances, he
   asserted, describing the practice as inhuman and unnecessary.On
   minority issues, he drew attention to ethnic Albanians in South Serbia.

   ANTJE LEENDERTSE (Germany), aligning herself with the European Union,
   called for the protection of human rights for all people in Ukraine as
   well as effective accountability to provide justice to victims and
   deter future human rights violations. Stressing that her State is an
   elected member of the Human Rights Council, she detailed Berlin’s
   commitment to the promotion of human rights, including eradication of
   the death penalty. She called on China to cooperate with the Office of
   the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) and
   implement recommendations on the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region. She
   highlighted Berlin’s feminist foreign policy, while noting that there
   is a long way to go in achieving gender equality in her country.She
   added that the case of Mahsa Amini in Iran and protests following her
   death in police custody show us the importance of this goal in a
   dramatic way. She further highlighted the crucial role of human rights
   defenders, civil society activists and non-governmental organizations
   in protecting human rights.

   KENNEDY GODFREY GASTORN (United Republic of Tanzania) said his
   Government ensures access to multiple sources of information as well as
   to justice. To that end, it passed the Legal Aid Act, which guarantees
   that cases involving vulnerable groups such as women children as well
   as the elderly are expedited. Detailing its Vision 2025, he said the
   country has implemented development initiatives to improve conditions
   for all, including a mega hydroelectric power plant as well as
   investments in a standard gauge railway line and the health and
   education sectors.

   ANA PAULA BAPTISTA GRADE ZACARIAS (Portugal), aligning herself with the
   European Union, stressed the need to take stock of what has been
   achieved so far and what remains to be done in the face of escalating
   conflict and barbaric aggression, persistent human-rights violations
   and the reversal of women’s rights around the world.One achievement is
   the establishment of the Human Rights Council, which is a credible body
   that can respond in real-time to violations of human rights and
   abuses.Further, it creates awareness of pioneering issues such as the
   links between human rights and the environment, mental health and
   cyberbullying.She added that the Universal Periodic Review mechanism is
   a “fantastic equalizer”, demonstrating that no country is immune to
   scrutiny, no country has a perfect human-rights record and that States
   must learn from each other.

   Right of Reply

   In exercise of the right of reply, the delegate of Saudi Arabia,
   responding to the United States, said that freedom of expression in his
   country is guaranteed if what is said is respectful of public order and
   others’ freedoms. He said that there must be credible sources for
   claims.

   The representative of Cuba rejected statements made about his country
   by the representative of the United States.These are part of an
   international campaign against Cuba, he said, orchestrated and financed
   from the United States, that has nothing to do with human rights;
   rather, they seek to alter Cuba’s constitutional order. It is not
   surprising that the United States included only developing countries in
   its list, as that country has a long history of manipulating this
   matter against the Global South, while remaining silent on what occurs
   on its territory or that of its allies.Underscoring that the United
   States has no license to pass judgment on anyone, he said that country
   is responsible for human-rights abuses and violations that are brutal
   and well-documented.“The United States has nothing to teach Cuba on
   human rights,” he stressed, adding that, if the United States has any
   concerns about the well-being of the Cuban people, it should end its
   blockade.

   The representative of China, speaking in exercise of the right of
   reply, categorically rejected claims made by the delegation of the
   United States. Regrettably, the United States and other countries have
   persisted in their baseless accusations and malicious smears against
   China, he stressed, adding that, rather than human rights, they care
   about interference in China’s internal affairs under the pretext of
   human rights to create chaos and maintain their own hegemony.Washington
   is obsessed with naming and shaming, while turning a blind eye to its
   own poor human rights situation, he said, pointing to systematic racism
   in the United States and crimes against humanity committed by its
   military in Afghanistan, Syria, and other countries.
