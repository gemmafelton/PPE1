Ask the Expert: What is critical race theory and why is it under attack in
our schools?

   "Ask the Expert" articles provide information and insights from MSU
   scientists, researchers and scholars about national and global issues,
   complex research and general-interest subjects based on their areas of
   academic expertise and study. They may feature historical information,
   background, research findings, or offer tips.

   Michigan joins other states that have introduced legislation that would
   sharply limit classroom discussions on how race and racism have shaped
   American history.


   [36]Dorinda Carter Andrews, professor and chairperson, [37]Department
   of Teacher Education at Michigan State University's [38]College of
   Education, said this is an ill-formed conflation, and answers other
   questions about critical race theory.


   Dorinda Carter Andrews, professor and chairperson, Department of
   Teacher Education at Michigan State University's College of Education.


   What is critical race theory?


   Critical race theory, or CRT, is a framework developed in the 1970s by
   legal scholars that argues white supremacy maintains power through the
   law and other legal systems. CRT dismisses the idea that racism stems
   from acts of individuals but rather rooted in a system of oppression
   based on socially constructed racial hierarchy where white people reap
   material benefits over people of color resulting from misuse of
   power.


   Teaching young people about race and racism is not synonymous with
   teaching them critical race theory. Critical race theory is not an
   ideology or a political orientation that assumes white people are bad;
   it assumes white supremacy is bad in all of its forms. It's a practice
   or approach that provides language and a lens for examining racism at
   institutional and structural levels. Underlying this is the premise
   that racism is endemic to American society and that white supremacist
   ideals and practices should be dismantled.



   Why are there proposals to ban critical race theory in schools?


   As of mid-May, legislation to outlaw CRT in schools [39]has passed in
   Idaho, Iowa, Oklahoma and Tennessee and have been proposed in various
   other statehouses. Since the onset of teaching about American history,
   teachers have been teaching about forms of systemic racial
   discrimination and oppression, including slavery. This is not new to
   schools. However, traditionally school curriculums have taken a
   Eurocentric approach.


   Now we are living in a time where the voices of people of color are
   being lifted up, and tragic events like George Floyd's death one year
   ago and violence against members of the Asian panethnic community prove
   that problems remain. The narrative of U.S. history is being
   diversified, and that is creating fear, particularly among white
   people. Teaching young people how to be antiracist should not be seen
   as an attack on American values. It's actually working in support of
   American ideals like inclusion and valuing diverse perspectives.



   Why is it important for students to learn about systemic racism in
   schools?


   It's important to try to help youth understand how bias and oppression
   are institutional, structural and systemic, and not simply
   interpersonal. Young people are not colorblind or color mute. They see
   color and they talk race and racism in their own social circles and
   peer groups. Research indicates that as early as age 3, children have
   negative associations about some racial groups. By the time they enter
   elementary school, children already have a level of racial literacy
   that evidences their awareness that some individuals and groups are
   treated differently in their schools and society based on skin color.
   This is particularly apparent for elementary-aged children of color. If
   children of color are old enough to experience racial discrimination
   and injustice, then all children, especially white children, are old
   enough to learn about racism in ways that enhance their cross-cultural
   competency, racial literacy skills and skill set for improving our
   democracy.



   What is proposed in the Michigan legislation?


   A new bill introduced to the Michigan Legislature would sharply limit
   Michigan classroom discussions of how race and racism have shaped
   American history. Under the legislation introduced, K-12 school
   districts would lose 5% of their funding if educators teach critical
   race theory, "anti-American" ideas about race in America, or material
   from The 1619 Project, a New York Times initiative that puts Black
   history and the consequences of slavery at the center of the U.S.
   national narrative. School funding penalties tied to implementing
   antiracist curriculum is actually a racist move that furthers systemic
   racial oppression in education, disadvantages all children, and upholds
   white supremacist ideals.



   What are the possible consequences of this legislation?


   The bills are vague and it's unclear what they will cover and if they
   are constitutional, or whether they impermissibly restrict free speech.


   It would be difficult to monitor what goes on inside hundreds of
   thousands of classrooms. Educators fear that such laws could have a
   sobering effect on teachers who might censor lessons out of concern for
   parent or administrator complaints. Additionally, such bills can
   actually work to undermine educational goals of diversifying the
   teaching workforce. Students of color may be less likely to pursue a
   teaching career if there is censorship around race talk across subject
   areas.
