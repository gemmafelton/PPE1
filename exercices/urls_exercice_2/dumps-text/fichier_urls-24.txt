   Cricket South Africa's Social Justice and Nation-Building (SJN)
   hearings on racial discrimination in the game started on Monday after
   former players shared their unpleasant experiences. (More Cricket News)

   The hearings will go on till July 23 and as many as 58 submissions are
   likely to be heard, according to a report in 'ESPNcricinfo'.

   SJN ombudsman Advocate Dumisa Ntsebeza said he had received 11
   submissions from administrators and officials, 23 from former and
   present players, and 24 from cricket unions and other interested
   parties.

   Ntsebeza will have to submit a final report regarding racism within the
   sport to the organisation's Board of Directors by the end of September,
   with an aim to prevent discrimination in the future.

   "CSA fully supports the SJN initiative. We regard it as one of the most
   important and significant projects to be undertaken in the 30 years of
   our existence as a unified cricket body," Lawson Naidoo, CSA board
   chair, said in his address at the opening of the hearings as per the
   report.

   "The start of these hearing provides a key reset moment for CSA and
   cricket in general, an opportunity to address the past failures."

   The hearings were initially due to be held in May but were postponed
   after concerns about the process were raised by, among others, David
   Becker, who is the counsel for CSA's director of cricket Graeme Smith
   and anti-corruption chief Louis Cole.

   Another reason for the delay is that Ntzebeza was also engaged at the
   African Human Rights Court in Tanzania.

   Among others, the ombudsman is tasked with determining the "causes,
   nature and extent" of racial discrimination within South African
   cricket.

   The sensitive subject gained momentum last year in the wake of the
   Black Lives Matter movement, with former South African cricketers
   making allegations of racial discrimination against them.

   "Not everything that is faced can be changed, but nothing can be
   changed until it's faced," Ntsebeza said.

   "This is a quote from James Baldwin, which speaks to the purpose the
   SJN Project," he added.

   The hearings will include testimonies from those who have suffered
   racial discrimination, either by written statement on affidavit or oral
   statement under oath.

       After years of coercion and co-option, adivasis are fighting for
       their religious identity and rights, forcing political parties to
       take note. In the latest issue of Outlook, read an English
       translation of adivasi poet Jacinta Kerketta's poem that shames the
       destroyers of adivasi culture. Here Kerketta reads the original
