Poll finds at least half of Black Americans say they have experienced racial
discrimination in their jobs and from the police

   people in crowd

   For immediate release: October 24, 2017

   Boston, MA - This report is part of a series titled "Discrimination in
   America." The series is based on a survey conducted for National Public
   Radio, the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, and Harvard T.H. Chan School
   of Public Health. While many surveys have explored Americans' beliefs
   about discrimination, this survey asks people about their own personal
   experiences with discrimination.

   Half or more of Black Americans report being personally
   discriminated against in the workplace and when interacting with police

   In the context of institutional forms of discrimination, half or more
   of Black Americans report being personally discriminated against
   because they are Black when it comes to being paid equally or
   considered for promotion (57%), when applying for jobs (56%), or when
   interacting with police (50%) (Chart 1).
   [66]chart NPR/Robert Wood Johnson Foundation/Harvard T.H. Chan School
   of Public Health, Discrimination in America: Experiences and Views of
   African Americans, January 26 - April 9, 2017. S5/Q13, S6/Q15, Q17,
   Q19, Q21, S7/Q23, S8/Q25. Each question asked of half-sample. Total
   N=802 African-American U.S. adults.

   "What is portrayed in the daily news about racial discrimination in
   America corresponds to the very real personal experiences of Black
   Americans today, particularly in the areas of employment, interacting
   with the police, and housing," says [67]Robert Blendon, Richard L.
   Menschel Professor of Health Policy and Political Analysis at Harvard
   T.H. Chan School of Public Health, who co-directed the survey.

   In a separate question, 60% of Black Americans say that they or a
   family member have been unfairly stopped or treated by the police
   because they are Black, and 45% say they or a family member have been
   treated unfairly by the courts because they are Black (Chart 2).

   of Public Health, Discrimination in America: Experiences and Views of
   African Americans, January 26 - April 9, 2017. Q91. Question asked of
   half-sample. Total N=802 African-American U.S. adults.

   Half of Black Americans have experienced racial slurs and negative
   comments; Roughly four in ten have experienced violence and threats or
   harassment

   In the context of individual or interpersonal forms of discrimination,
   at least half of Black Americans say they have personally experienced
   people using racial slurs against them (51%) or making insensitive or
   offensive comments about their race or ethnicity (52%) (Chart 3).

   African Americans, January 26 - April 9, 2017. Q63a/Q64a, Q63b/ Q64b,
   Q63c/Q64c, Q91. Each question asked of half-sample. Total N=802
   African-American U.S. adults.

   Additionally, roughly four in ten Black Americans say they have
   experienced people acting afraid of them (40%) because of their race,
   and further that they or a family member have experienced [70]violence
   (42%) or threats or non-sexual harassment (35%) because they are Black
   (Chart 3).

   Harvard professor David Williams on health consequences of
   discrimination

   [71]David Williams, PhD, MPH, the Florence Sprague Norman and Laura
   Smart Norman Professor of Public Health at the Harvard T.H. Chan School
   of Public Health and Professor of African and African American Studies
   and Sociology at Harvard University, says that it's well documented
   that Black Americans generally have poorer health and die sooner than
   whites in America. The effects of experiencing discrimination, in both
   institutional and individual contexts, can accumulate over time and
   trigger an array of [72]health problems, including elevated blood
   pressure, [73]heart disease, and even premature aging or mortality,
   among others. Williams says, "This poll helps us see where we need to
   take action to address the problem."

   A third of Black Americans have been personally discriminated against
   when seeking healthcare

   The poll also found that in the context of healthcare, roughly one
   third (32%) of Black Americans say they have been personally
   discriminated against because they are Black when going to a doctor or
   health clinic (Chart 1).

   Additionally, 22% of Black Americans say they have avoided seeking
   medical care for themselves or a member of their family out of concern
   they would be discriminated against because they are Black.

   Black Americans see individual prejudice as a larger problem than laws
   and governmental policies

   Overall, 92% of Black Americans said they believe that discrimination
   against Black people exists in America today. Among those, nearly half
   (49%) say that discrimination based on individuals' prejudice is the
   larger problem, while 25% say discrimination based in laws and
   government policies is the larger problem. Another 25% say both forms
   of discrimination are equally a problem.

   on the poll. A multi-part series will also air on NPR starting Oct.
   24.)

   Survey Background

   The survey was conducted January 26-April 9, 2017, among a nationally
   representative, probability-based telephone (cell and landline) sample
   of 3,453 adults age 18 or older. The survey included nationally
   representative samples of African Americans, Latinos, Asian Americans,
   Native Americans, as well as white Americans; men and women, and LGBTQ
   adults. This report presents the results specifically for a nationally
   representative probability sample of 802 African-American U.S. adults.
   Future reports will analyze each other group, and the final report will
   discuss major highlights from the series.
