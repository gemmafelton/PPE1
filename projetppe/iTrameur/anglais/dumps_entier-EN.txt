Stephen Miller-led group emerges as top legal foe of Biden initiatives

   Stephen Miller's law group says it's fighting 'racism against White
   people'

   CNN  --

   A conservative legal group led by former top Trump aide Stephen Miller
   has emerged as a frequent opponent to several Biden administration
   initiatives by mounting court challenges, succeeding in blocking
   policies they say are examples of reverse discrimination.

   Miller touts America First Legal as "the long-awaited answer to the
   (American Civil Liberties Union)," and his group has garnered several
   legal victories against the Biden administration in the past few weeks
   and months, most notably on issues of racialdiscrimination.

   The group has aired advertisements criticizing the Biden
   administration's policies on LGBTQ rights and has filed a class-action
   lawsuit against [134]Texas A&M University, claiming the college has
   "engaged in a discriminatory hiring practice, choosing which candidates
   to hire based on their race or sex." That lawsuit is ongoing.

   In 2021, America First Legal was also successful in halting some
   Covid-19 relief funds under the [135]Small Business Administration's
   Restaurant Revitalization Fund to women, veterans and minority business
   owners who could apply for grants during a priority period in its
   initial rollout, a move Miller [136]argued was an "unconstitutional and
   racially discriminatory scheme."

   Perhaps most notably, the organization was involved in legal challenges
   that forced the Biden administration to create a work-around on getting
   [137]debt relief for farmers of color. An effort passed as part of the
   Covid-19-related American Rescue Plan in 2021 was challenged in court
   by a litany of lawsuits by some White farmers who complained that the
   effort to remedy longstanding inequities by wiping the debt of only
   farmers of color was itself discriminatory.

   America First Legal [138]filed a lawsuit against the effort,
   representing Texas Agriculture Commissioner Sid Miller and a group of
   White farmers in the state who also argued that the program is
   unconstitutional because of racialdiscrimination. The lawsuits led to
   [139]an injunction that blocked the debt relief payments.

   Attorneys argued that the USDA's definition of "socially disadvantaged
   farmer and rancher" that excludes Whites is "patently
   unconstitutional." They also said the agency was violating the
   Constitution by "discriminating on the grounds of race, color, and
   national origin" in the program and that the court should prohibit the
   clause from being enforced.

   Ultimately, the administration abandoned the effort and quietly tucked
   a couple provisions into the Inflation Reduction Act that passed over
   the summer to allocate debt relief that is eligible to farmers of all
   backgrounds, regardless of race.

   CNN has reached out to America First Legal for comment.

   Several Black farmers and social justice advocates have said Miller's
   actions are harmful.

   "I want to set the record straight - no one is against White farmers in
   this country," John Boyd Jr., 57, a fourth-generation farmer who is
   founder and president of the National Black Farmers Association, told
   CNN. He added that what Miller is doing to Black farmers through the
   legal challenges is "humiliating and the worst thing you can do for
   race-relations in this country."

   Dorian Spence, a lawyer whose firm represented the Federation of
   Southern Cooperatives, a group of southern cooperatives that has been
   advocating for Black farmers in litigation brought by White farmers,
   told CNN that Miller's group uses "grievance politics through the rule
   of law to try to exclude people of color broadly, but in certain
   pockets Black people specifically from areas of opportunity."

   "America First sees an America that is increasingly White, White
   male-driven," Spence said.

   CNN's Jessica Schneider contributed to this report.

Poll finds at least half of Black Americans say they have experienced racial
discrimination in their jobs and from the police

   people in crowd

   For immediate release: October 24, 2017

   Boston, MA - This report is part of a series titled "Discrimination in
   America." The series is based on a survey conducted for National Public
   Radio, the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, and Harvard T.H. Chan School
   of Public Health. While many surveys have explored Americans' beliefs
   about discrimination, this survey asks people about their own personal
   experiences with discrimination.

   Half or more of Black Americans report being personally
   discriminated against in the workplace and when interacting with police

   In the context of institutional forms of discrimination, half or more
   of Black Americans report being personally discriminated against
   because they are Black when it comes to being paid equally or
   considered for promotion (57%), when applying for jobs (56%), or when
   interacting with police (50%) (Chart 1).
   [66]chart NPR/Robert Wood Johnson Foundation/Harvard T.H. Chan School
   of Public Health, Discrimination in America: Experiences and Views of
   African Americans, January 26 - April 9, 2017. S5/Q13, S6/Q15, Q17,
   Q19, Q21, S7/Q23, S8/Q25. Each question asked of half-sample. Total
   N=802 African-American U.S. adults.

   "What is portrayed in the daily news about racialdiscrimination in
   America corresponds to the very real personal experiences of Black
   Americans today, particularly in the areas of employment, interacting
   with the police, and housing," says [67]Robert Blendon, Richard L.
   Menschel Professor of Health Policy and Political Analysis at Harvard
   T.H. Chan School of Public Health, who co-directed the survey.

   In a separate question, 60% of Black Americans say that they or a
   family member have been unfairly stopped or treated by the police
   because they are Black, and 45% say they or a family member have been
   treated unfairly by the courts because they are Black (Chart 2).

   African Americans, January 26 - April 9, 2017. Q91. Question asked of
   half-sample. Total N=802 African-American U.S. adults.

   Half of Black Americans have experienced racial slurs and negative
   comments; Roughly four in ten have experienced violence and threats or
   harassment

   In the context of individual or interpersonal forms of discrimination,
   at least half of Black Americans say they have personally experienced
   people using racial slurs against them (51%) or making insensitive or
   offensive comments about their race or ethnicity (52%) (Chart 3).

   Q63c/Q64c, Q91. Each question asked of half-sample. Total N=802
   African-American U.S. adults.

   Additionally, roughly four in ten Black Americans say they have
   experienced people acting afraid of them (40%) because of their race,
   and further that they or a family member have experienced [70]violence
   (42%) or threats or non-sexual harassment (35%) because they are Black
   (Chart 3).

   Harvard professor David Williams on health consequences of
   discrimination

   [71]David Williams, PhD, MPH, the Florence Sprague Norman and Laura
   Smart Norman Professor of Public Health at the Harvard T.H. Chan School
   of Public Health and Professor of African and African American Studies
   and Sociology at Harvard University, says that it's well documented
   that Black Americans generally have poorer health and die sooner than
   whites in America. The effects of experiencing discrimination, in both
   institutional and individual contexts, can accumulate over time and
   trigger an array of [72]health problems, including elevated blood
   pressure, [73]heart disease, and even premature aging or mortality,
   among others. Williams says, "This poll helps us see where we need to
   take action to address the problem."

   A third of Black Americans have been personally discriminated against
   when seeking healthcare

   The poll also found that in the context of healthcare, roughly one
   third (32%) of Black Americans say they have been personally
   discriminated against because they are Black when going to a doctor or
   health clinic (Chart 1).

   Additionally, 22% of Black Americans say they have avoided seeking
   medical care for themselves or a member of their family out of concern
   they would be discriminated against because they are Black.

   Black Americans see individual prejudice as a larger problem than laws
   and governmental policies

   Overall, 92% of Black Americans said they believe that discrimination
   against Black people exists in America today. Among those, nearly half
   (49%) say that discrimination based on individuals' prejudice is the
   larger problem, while 25% say discrimination based in laws and
   government policies is the larger problem. Another 25% say both forms
   of discrimination are equally a problem.

   on the poll. A multi-part series will also air on NPR starting Oct.
   24.)

   Survey Background

   The survey was conducted January 26-April 9, 2017, among a nationally
   representative, probability-based telephone (cell and landline) sample
   of 3,453 adults age 18 or older. The survey included nationally
   representative samples of African Americans, Latinos, Asian Americans,
   Native Americans, as well as white Americans; men and women, and LGBTQ
   adults. This report presents the results specifically for a nationally
   representative probability sample of 802 African-American U.S. adults.
   Future reports will analyze each other group, and the final report will
   discuss major highlights from the series.

Why Does Racial Inequality Persist?Culture, Causation, and Responsibility

Racial Inequality: A Conceptual Framework

   Over the last 40 years, I've explored why, notwithstanding the success
   of the civil rights movement, the subordinate status of
   African-Americans persists. Key to my thinking about this intractable
   problem has been the need to distinguish the role played by
   discrimination against black people from that played by
   counterproductive behavioral patterns among blacks.

   This puts what is a very sensitive issue rather starkly. Many vocal
   advocates for racial equality have been loath to consider the
   possibility that problematic patterns of behavior could be an important
   factor contributing to our persisting disadvantaged status. Some
   observers on the right of American politics, meanwhile, take the
   position that discrimination against blacks is no longer an important
   determinant of unequal social outcomes. I have long tried to chart a
   middle course--acknowledging antiblack biases that should be remedied
   while insisting on addressing and reversing the patterns of behavior
   that impede black people from seizing newly opened opportunities to
   prosper. I still see this as the most sensible position.

   These two positions can be recast as causal narratives. One is what I
   call the "bias narrative": racism and white supremacy have done us
   wrong; we can't get ahead until they relent; so we must continue urging
   the reform of white American society toward that end.

   The other is what I call the "development narrative," according to
   which it is essential to consider how a person comes to acquire those
   skills, traits, habits, and orientations that foster successful
   participation in American society. To the extent that African-American
   youngsters do not have the experiences, are not exposed to the
   influences, and do not benefit from the resources that foster and
   facilitate their human development, they fail to achieve their full
   human potential. This lack of development is what ultimately causes the
   persistent, stark racial disparities in income, wealth, education,
   family structure, and much else. (The charts and tables on this and the
   next several pages offer a glimpse of the magnitude of these
   disparities.)

   In terms of prescribing intervention and remedy, these causal
   narratives point in very different directions. The bias narrative says
   that we need to have a "conversation" about race: white America must
   reform itself; racism must end; we need more of this or that, whatever
   the "this" or "that" is on the agenda of today's race reformers. One
   hears this kind of talk, one reads these exhortations, in newspapers
   and other media every day.

   The development narrative puts more onus on the responsibilities of
   African-Americans to develop our human potential. It is not satisfied
   with wishful thinking like: "If we could only double the budget for
   some social program, the homicide rate among young African-American men
   would be less atrocious." Or, "If we can just get this police
   department investigated by the Department of Justice, then...." The
   development narrative asks, Then what? Then it will be safe to walk on
   the south side of Chicago after midnight?

   Meanwhile, the terms themselves--race and discrimination--are often
   bandied about without being rigorously defined. In a 2002 book, The
   Anatomy of Racial Inequality, I sketched a theory of race applicable to
   the social and historical circumstances of the U.S., speculated about
   why racial inequalities persist, and advanced a conceptual framework
   for thinking about social justice in matters of race.[[150]1] Because
   there remains so much confusion in today's public discussions about
   race and racial inequality, I need to revisit that framework. Bear with
   me. The relevance of this conceptual excursion will be clear soon
   enough.

Categorization Versus Signification

   For me, the term "race" refers to indelible and heritable marks on
   human bodies--skin color, hair texture, bone structure--that are of no
   intrinsic significance but that nevertheless have, through time, come
   to be invested with social expectations that are more or less
   reasonable and social meanings that are more or less durable. When we
   talk about race in America or anywhere else, we are actually dealing
   with two distinct processes: categorization and signification.
   Categorization entails sorting people into a small number of subsets
   based on bodily marks and differentiating one's dealings with such
   persons accordingly. It is a cognitive act--an effort to comprehend the
   social world around us.

   Signification is an interpretative act--one that associates certain
   connotations or "social meanings" with those categories. Informational
   and symbolic issues are both at play. Or, as I like to put it, when we
   speak about race, we are really talking about "embodied social
   signification."[[151]2]

   It is instructive to contrast a social-cognitive conception of race
   with acts of biological taxonomy--sorting humans based on presumed
   variations of genetic endowments across what had for eons been
   geographically isolated subpopulations. Such isolation was, until
   recently, the human condition, and it may be thought to have led to the
   emergence of distinct races. Nevertheless, using the term "race" in
   this way is controversial, particularly if the aim is to explain social
   inequalities between groups.

   Thus, scientists, such as the population geneticist Luigi
   Cavalli-Sforza,[[152]3] and social critics, such as the philosopher
   Anthony Appiah,[[153]4] deny that "race" refers to anything real. What
   they have in mind is the biological-taxonomic notion, and what they
   deny is that meaningful distinctions among human subgroups pertinent to
   accounting for racial inequality can be derived from this notion. I am
   not arguing this point--though it would appear to be eminently
   arguable. What I am emphasizing is that to establish the scientific
   invalidity of race demonstrates neither the irrationality nor the
   immorality of invoking racial classification as acts of social
   cognition. So I shall employ the concept of race here, with an emphasis
   on the negative interpretative/symbolic connotations attached to
   "blackness" in the U.S.[[154]5]

Reward Bias Versus Development Bias

   Given this theoretical understanding of race, what might one say about
   the causes of persistent racial inequality? Fundamental is the
   elemental distinction I first drew in 2002 between racial
   discrimination and racial stigma. Discrimination is about how blacks
   are treated; stigma is about how blacks are perceived.

   What I call "reward bias" (conventional racialdiscrimination) is now a
   less significant barrier to the full participation of African-Americans
   in U.S. society than what I call "development bias." Reward bias
   focuses on the disadvantageous treatment of black people in formal
   transactions that limits their rewards for skills and talents presented
   to the market. Development bias refers to impediments that block access
   for black people to those resources necessary to develop and refine
   their talents but that are conveyed via informal social relations. This
   is where the consideration of culture enters the picture.

   Reward bias is grounded in racially discriminatory transactions, but
   development bias is ultimately rooted in racially stigmatized social
   relations. Many resources that foster human development only become
   available to persons as the by-product of informal, race-influenced
   social interactions. Another way to put this expanded view of
   discrimination: reward bias reflects discrimination in contract while
   development bias reflects discrimination in contact.

   Obviously, these two forms of bias are not mutually exclusive. The
   acquisition of skills can be blocked by overt discriminatory treatment,
   and a regime of market discrimination under pressure from the forces of
   economic competition may require informal instruments of social control
   to maintain that discriminatory regime.[[155]6] Though both kinds of
   bias promote racial inequality, the distinction is useful.

   The moral problem presented by reward bias is straightforward and calls
   for an uncontroversial remedy: laws against overt racial
   discrimination. Development bias presents a subtler and more insidious
   ethical challenge that may be difficult to remedy via public policies
   in any way that garners majoritarian support. Ultimately, development
   bias deals with some cultural patterns that are characteristic of both
   a racial minority group and the society at large, while reward bias
   deals with overt antiblack discriminatory treatment that, even though
   it has not been fully eliminated, is nevertheless nearly universally
   condemned.

   The difficulties for remedying development bias have a cognitive and an
   ethical dimension. In terms of cognition, when confronted with a racial
   group's poor social performance, an observer may be unable to
   distinguish between blocked developmental opportunities and limited
   capacities or distorted values. In ethical terms, citizens who find the
   "transactional discrimination" associated with reward bias to be
   noxious may be less offended by the covert, subconscious "relational
   discrimination" that underlies development bias.[[156]7]

   Regarding the distinction between reward bias and development bias: to
   understand persistent racial inequality in America, it is crucial to
   put relations before transactions. The focus on discriminatory economic
   transactions may not be sufficient; one will need also to consider the
   consequences of racially stigmatized social relations. Stigma--the
   distorted social meanings attaching to "blackness"--inhibits the access
   that some black people have to those networks of social affiliation
   where developmental resources are most readily appropriated. This might
   happen because black people are socially excluded; it might also happen
   because we choose to be socially withdrawn.

   On this view, persistent inequality may no longer be due mainly to a
   racially discriminatory marketplace, or an administrative state that
   refuses to reward black talent equally, as was the case in decades
   past. Rather, today's problem may be due, in large part, to a
   race-tinged psychology of perception and valuation--a way of seeing
   black people, and a way of black people seeing themselves, that impedes
   the acquisition of traits that are valued in the marketplace and are
   essential for human development.

   This can lead to a vicious circle. The status of a racial group as
   stigmatized in the social imagination--and crucially, in its own
   self-understanding--can be rationalized and socially reproduced because
   of that group's subordinate position in the economic order. Moreover,
   this way of thinking implies that the explanatory categories of "racial
   discrimination" and "racially distinct behaviors" are not mutually
   exclusive.

Social Capital Versus Human Capital

   A quarter-century before the publication of The Anatomy of Racial
   Inequality, I coined the term "social capital" to help account for
   persistent racial inequality in the U.S.[[157]8] The concept behind
   social capital illuminates the difference between informal social
   relations and formal economic transactions--between reward and
   development bias--as mechanisms perpetuating the subordinate position
   of African-Americans.

   As an economist, I sought to differentiate social capital with the more
   familiar term in my own field: "human capital." Human-capital theory
   attempts to account for variation in people's earnings capacities by
   analogy with well-developed theories of investment. These theories
   begin with the assumption of competitive markets and rational choice by
   forward-looking individuals, and then analyze investment decisions in
   light of individuals' time preferences, their anticipated rates of
   return, and the available alternatives for uses of their time.
   Human-capital theory imports into the study of human inequality an
   intellectual framework that had been well developed in economics to
   explain the investment decisions of firms--a framework that focuses on
   the analysis of formal economic transactions.

   I argued that associating business with human investments is merely an
   analogy, not an identity--particularly if one seeks to explain
   persistent racial disparities. Human capital, as an economic concept,
   overlooks two important facts having to do with informal social
   relations.

   First, all human development is socially situated and mediated. Human
   development takes place between people, by way of human interactions,
   within social institutions--the family, the community, the school, the
   peer group. Many resources essential to human development, such as the
   attention that parents give to their children, are not alienable. These
   resources, for the most part, are not commodities and are not up for
   sale. Instead, structured connections between individuals create the
   context within which developmental resources come to be allocated to
   individual persons. Opportunity travels along the synapses of these
   social networks.

   The resulting allocation of developmental resources need not be
   responsive to prices or be economically efficient. The development of
   human beings is not the same as corporate investment, and it is not a
   good metaphor, or a good analogy, to reason as though this were so.

   Human development begins before birth. The decisions a mother
   makes--about how closely to attend to her health and nutrition during
   pregnancy, for instance--will alter the neurological development of her
   fetus. This, and a myriad of other decisions and actions, all come
   together to shape the experience of the infant, who will mature one day
   to become a human being, and about whom it will be said that he or she
   has this or that much productivity, as reflected in his or her wages or
   academic test scores.

   This productivity, the behavioral and cognitive capacities bearing on a
   person's social and economic functioning, are not merely the result of
   a mechanical infusion of material resources. Rather, these are
   by-products of social processes mediated by networks of human
   affiliation, and these processes are fundamentally important for
   understanding persistent racial disparities.

   Second, what we call "race" is mainly a social, and only indirectly a
   biological, phenomenon. The persistence across generations of racial
   differentiation between large groups of people, in an open society
   where individuals live in proximity to one another, provides
   irrefutable indirect evidence of a profound separation between the
   racially defined networks of social affiliation within that society.
   There would be no races in the steady state of any dynamic social
   system unless, on a daily basis and with regard to their most intimate
   affairs, people paid assiduous attention to the boundaries separating
   themselves from racially distinct others. Over time, race would cease
   to exist unless people chose to act in a manner so as biologically to
   reproduce the variety of phenotypic expression that constitutes the
   substance of racial distinction.

   If the goal is to understand durable racial inequality in a society,
   one needs to attend in detail to the processes that cause race to
   persist as a fact of life, because such processes will be related to
   the allocation of human developmental resources in that society.

   Race, as a feature of a society, rests upon the cultural conceptions
   about identity held by the people--in America, principally blacks and
   whites alike--in that society. These are the beliefs that people hold
   about who they are and about the legitimacy of conducting intimate
   relations (and not only sexual relations) with racially distinct
   others. Beliefs of this kind affect the access that people enjoy to
   those informal resources that individuals require to develop their
   human potential. Social capital is a critical prerequisite for creating
   what economists refer to as human capital.

   Any conceptual framework for the study of persistent racial inequality
   is incomplete if it fails to consider the interactions between those
   social processes ensuring the reproduction of racial difference, on one
   hand, and those processes facilitating human development, on the other
   hand. If we consider these interactions, it becomes easier to see the
   many intimate connections between the antiblack "racial bias" that
   liberals emphasize and the "behavioral pathology" of (some) blacks that
   (some) conservatives are so keen to focus on.

Nobody Is Coming to Save Us

   I know how difficult it can be to see those connections--it has taken
   me many years to recognize them. My doctoral dissertation included an
   essay that was very close to the liberal, "racial bias" narrative.
   History, I wrote, casts a long shadow. Contemporary racial inequality
   in America reflects a history of deprivation, discrimination, and
   dispossession of black people. We can't expect this problem to cure
   itself. Thus, social justice rightly understood would involve some kind
   of reparation. I didn't use that word, but I did advocate for some
   intervention by the state on behalf of the explicit goal of racial
   equality. Otherwise, I reasoned, we would be stuck indefinitely with
   the consequences of an unjust past.[[158]9]

   That was Glenn Loury circa 1976. By 1985, I had become a Reagan
   Republican, emphasizing the problems of single-parent families,
   out-of-wedlock births among blacks, low labor-force participation and
   educational performance, and high criminal and victimization rates. My
   favored formulation: there is an enemy without--namely, racism; but
   there is also an enemy within--namely, behavior patterns inhibiting
   African-Americans from seizing such opportunities as had come to exist.
   I stressed to other blacks that if we were ever to achieve equality
   within American society, we could not simply rely on the
   antidiscrimination laws and affirmative action; we would also have to
   address some of these internal behavioral patterns. I still believe
   this to be the case.

   By pointing to the "enemy within," I did not deny that the ultimate
   source of such adverse internal patterns might be historical
   discrimination. (Although as a social scientist, I recognized that this
   kind of causal inference question is nearly impossible to resolve
   convincingly by looking at data.) But it did not matter so much what
   the ultimate sources of internal behavioral patterns were; what
   mattered was how they were to be reversed.

   The majority of African-American children are born to a woman without a
   husband. It is extremely implausible to imagine how this would be
   reversed by government policies such as the redistribution of
   resources. (I am aware of no evidence to this effect.) If this trend is
   to be reversed at all, it would require a determined effort by
   African-Americans to think differently about our responsibilities to
   our children and to one another.

   And so I would say to fellow African-Americans: No one is coming to
   save us! The situation in which we find ourselves is unfair, but this
   is not a question of justice. Nobody is coming, and, more
   fundamentally, no one can come into the most intimate relations between
   our women and men, into the families and neighborhoods where our
   children are being raised, so as to reorder those cultural institutions
   in a manner that would be more developmentally constructive.

   These matters are ultimately and necessarily in the hands of
   African-Americans alone. They require facing up to such questions as:
   Who are we as a people? How should we live with one another? What will
   we do to honor the sacrifices that our ancestors made to leave us the
   opportunities we now enjoy? What do we owe our children?

   Think about black-on-black crime. Unemployment rates, wealth holdings,
   residential segregation, and biased policing all may be playing some
   role in this problem. But young black men are killing one another at
   extraordinary rates. Notwithstanding the potential beneficial effects
   of various social policies, no one is coming to save black people from
   that pathology. If we are not prepared to condemn this contemptible
   behavior and to cooperate with institutions of civil authority that are
   legitimately addressing it--if we are unable to recognize that this is
   a tragic failure with the way that black people are living--we will
   likely be facing exactly the same issues for many years to come.

"Bias Narratives" Can Take on (Viral) Lives of Their Own

   Today, as social-justice warriors take to the streets to protest
   against racism, it is important to recognize the role played by
   Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and other social media. Many people get
   news from online sources that play to the narrative that American
   society is overwhelmingly populated by white bigots; so incidents that
   are not at all representative nevertheless become iconic because they
   go viral. A student finds something resembling a noose near his
   dorm-room door; a security guard says to someone, "I am unsure whether
   you belong here. Let me see your ID"; customers are asked to leave a
   food-service establishment when the manager thinks that their behavior
   is inconsistent with the establishment's rules. These incidents become
   national events. It is not simply that something has happened, or that
   a lot of people know about something having happened. Rather, what
   matters is that a lot of people know that many people know of the
   incidents in question.

   Idiosyncratic occurrences then become "driving while black,"
   "barbecuing while black," "swimming while black," "shopping while
   black," "walking while black," and so forth. The narrative of pervasive
   antiblack racism becomes a trope. When millions of people focus on the
   same events and reinforce one another in their comments, declaring
   one's outrage at such incidents becomes a substitute for reasoning
   about what larger meaning, if any, should be attached to these events.

   I often ask people who tell me about these incidents: Why do we care?
   Why should I care whether a woman was asked to put out her cigarette
   when a police officer stopped her for a broken taillight on a dusty
   road in Texas? Is that supposed to be emblematic of the treatment of
   black people in this country?

   As a social scientist, I am loath to operate based on a few anecdotes.
   For many who embrace the bias narrative, however, that's what is
   happening. Incidents that are not representative but that are salient
   within a bias narrative go viral and shape the consciousness of many.
   The viral social construction of episodes that are not the substance of
   our lives comes to shape our politics via exaggerated projections onto
   the surface of our lives. This is not "politics"--if, by that term, we
   understand mechanisms of give-and-take and persuasion by means of which
   we govern ourselves. It is, rather, a certain kind of mass delusion.

   A big part of the problem is virtue signaling. Only certain kinds of
   (immoral) people would refuse to go along with these delusions, and too
   many of us wish not to be thought of as being one of those people, so
   we avoid expressing skepticism publicly. To do so--to repeat things
   being said by those who scoff at the outrage of the day and are thought
   to be racists--risks devaluing one's reputation among "progressives."

   My theory of political correctness: a cognitive and intellectual dead
   end where too many people are motivated to remain silent on critical
   questions, to voice empty platitudes, or even to say things that they
   don't believe, all by their need to avoid appearing as though they're
   on the wrong side of history.[[159]10]

Those Who Downplay Behavioral Disparities Are Bluffing

   People on the left of American politics who claim that "white
   supremacy," "implicit bias," and old-fashioned discrimination account
   for black disadvantage are daring you to disagree. Their implicit
   rebuke is that, if you do not agree, you are saying that there's
   something intrinsically wrong with black people, or with black culture;
   you must be a racist who thinks that blacks are inferior. Otherwise,
   they say, how else could one explain the disparities? Behavior? That
   leads to the accusation that you are "blaming the victim."

   But this is a bluff. It is a rhetorical sleight-of-hand, a debater's
   trick. Why? Consider a statement that "mass incarceration," the high
   number of blacks in jails and prisons, is self-evidently a sign of
   American racism. If you respond that it's mainly a sign of the
   pathological behavior of criminals who happen to be black, you risk
   being called a racist. Yet common sense, not to mention the evidence,
   suggests that people are not being arrested, tried, convicted, and
   sentenced because they are black. Rather, prisons are full of people
   who have broken the law, who have hurt other people, who have violated
   the basic rules of civility. Prison is not a conspiracy to confine
   black people. I maintain that no serious person believes that it is.
   Not really.

   The young black men taking one another's lives on the streets of St.
   Louis, Baltimore, and Chicago are exhibiting behavioral pathology,
   plain and simple. The people they kill are mainly black, and the
   families who live with the misery are mainly black. Ascribing that to
   white racism is laughable. Nobody believes it. Not really.

   Consider educational test-score data. Antiracism advocates are, in
   effect, daring you to say that some groups send their children to the
   elite universities in outsize numbers compared with other groups
   because their academic preparation is magnitudes higher and better.
   Such excellence is an achievement.[[160]11]

   One is not born with the knowledge, skills, and academic ability to
   gain admission into elite colleges. The people who acquire these skills
   do so through effort. Why do some youngsters acquire the skills while
   others do not? That is a deep question requiring a serious answer. The
   simple answer--that this disparity is due to racism, and anyone who
   says otherwise is a racist--is not serious. Do such disparate outcomes
   have nothing to do with behavior, with cultural patterns, with what
   peer groups value, with how people spend their time, with what they
   identify as being critical to their self-respect? Anyone who believes
   that is, at best, a fool.

   Asians are said, sardonically, to be a "model minority." As a matter of
   fact, quite a compelling case can be made that "culture" is critical to
   their success. Jennifer Lee and Min Zhou interviewed Asian families in
   Southern California, trying to learn how their kids get into Dartmouth,
   Columbia, and Cornell at such high rates.[[161]12] They found that
   these families do exhibit cultural patterns, embrace values, adopt
   practices, engage in behavior, and follow disciplines that orient them
   so as to facilitate the achievements of their children. It defies
   common sense, as well as the evidence, to assert that they do not, or,
   conversely, to assert that the paucity of African-Americans performing
   at the very top of the intellectual spectrum--I am talking about
   academic excellence and about the low relative numbers of blacks who
   exhibit it--has nothing to do with behavior, that it is due entirely to
   institutional forces. That is an absurdity.

   Some 70% of African-American babies are born to a woman without a
   husband. Is this a good thing? Is it due to the ongoing practice of
   antiblack racism? Some people say these things. Do they really believe
   these things, or are they daring you to deny them?

   The 21st-century failures of too many African-Americans to take
   advantage of the opportunities created by the civil rights revolution
   are palpable, yet they are denied at every turn. This position is
   untenable. The end of Jim Crow segregation and the advent of equal
   rights for blacks were game changers. A half-century later, the deep
   disparities that remain are shameful and are due in large part to the
   behaviors of black people.

   People tout the racial wealth gap as, ipso facto, an indictment of the
   system--even while black Caribbean and African immigrants are starting
   businesses, penetrating the professions, and presenting themselves at
   Ivy League institutions in outsize numbers. They are behaving, although
   black, like other immigrant groups in our nation's past. True, they are
   immigrants, not natives, and immigration can be positively selectived.
   But something is dreadfully wrong when adverse patterns of behavior
   readily visible in the black American population go without being
   adequately discussed--to the point that anybody daring to mention them
   is labeled a racist.

   Thus, the Obama administration's Department of Education issued a "Dear
   Colleague Letter"[[162]13] that sought to cajole local school districts
   around the country to narrow the racial disparity in the suspension
   rates of students for disruptive behavior. The letter was supposedly
   advice--but failure to narrow the disparity meant that the district
   could be found guilty of a civil rights violation and potentially lose
   federal funding. Trump's secretary of education, Betsy DeVos, rescinded
   that letter--resulting in a great deal of consternation.

   Of course, if teachers, principals, guidance counselors, and
   school-based police officers are discriminating by race when they
   discipline students, the Department of Education and the Department of
   Justice should get involved. But based on all that we know--for
   instance, about crime and incarceration rates--it is at least plausible
   that there is an objective racial disparity in the frequency of
   disruptive behavior that occasions a difference in the suspension
   statistics. If behavior, not racism, is at the bottom of racially
   disparate suspension rates, think of the disservice being done--to the
   schoolchildren who act out (by failing to teach the lesson that bad
   behavior has consequences), to classmates (including, of course,
   minority students) who are hindered from getting an education by
   disruptive classroom behavior, and to teachers, who are trying to
   maintain a safe environment for learning.

   One more example of how this bluffing can do harm: the
   affirmative-action debate. We are now on the verge of permanently
   including African-Americans in elite and selective academic
   institutions through an openly acknowledged use of different standards.
   That is horrible--and not because of the Fourteenth Amendment, though
   the Supreme Court may yet find it so. It's horrible because this is not
   equality. It is patronizing. It is horrible for black Americans to
   embrace, and the establishment to adopt, a set of practices rooted in
   the soft bigotry of low expectations. Yet other than Clarence Thomas,
   Thomas Sowell, and a few others, there is not even a debate among
   African-Americans about what should be a first-order question, if the
   goal is to attain genuine racial equality.

No Responsibility Means No Glory

   If the negative cultural patterns in some African-American communities
   are said to be a necessary consequence of oppression, what is one to
   make of positive cultural patterns of behavior? Are they, too, a
   necessary consequence of oppression? If an individual or a community
   refuses to take responsibility for failure, how can they claim any
   glory for success? No blame? No skin in the game? Then no credit.

   You cannot help the hand you are dealt; but you can decide how to play
   it. To cast oneself as a helpless victim, to filter experience
   constantly and at every instance through a sieve that catches
   everything that one has control over while leaving the outcome to
   invisible, implacable historical forces: something is pathetic about
   that posture.

   The struggle for equal rights for black people, from abolition through
   the civil rights movement, has always been thought of as a "freedom
   struggle." But with freedom, rightly understood, comes responsibility.
   It is past time for all of us to start performing without a net. Rather
   than lamenting the lack of black billionaires, an outcome ascribed to
   some invisible force called "racism," one can admit that you will never
   become a billionaire unless you build a billion-dollar business--which
   begins by starting a business. One will never win a Nobel Prize in
   physics unless one learns calculus at the age of 12. What black parents
   are insisting that their 12-year-old kids learn calculus--those few
   kids capable of doing so? White people are not responsible for the fact
   that black people are, or are not, doing this.

Not All Black People Are the Same

   All this having been said about the behavioral roots of racial
   inequality, it is dangerous to talk about "black culture" as if it were
   only one thing--with pathological behavior (such as high levels of
   urban violence) becoming a stereotype about all black people. Here an
   insight by UCLA sociologist Rogers Brubaker is crucial for
   understanding race and inequality: one should never invoke racial
   aggregates as the subjects of social analysis unreflectively.[[163]14]

   This is a major concern among African-Americans about "culture talk."
   Culture talk overly focuses on pathology; but many positive things
   could be mentioned that will not typically appear in an op-ed. Black
   people are not a this or a that. They are a population in excess of 30
   million, with cultural patterns as variegated as one would expect in
   such a large aggregation.

   Moreover, American society is a polyglot mixture where cultural
   dynamics influence one another. For example, some middle-class,
   suburban white kids download rap music produced by black artists from
   the inner city. These musicians come to have a market substantially
   influenced by the preferences of their middle-class white customers. To
   a certain degree, they play to that audience, including that audience's
   stereotypes about thuggish behavior. Along comes a schoolteacher who
   announces: "Rap music is bad, and it's pathological. Can't you see just
   how troubled black people are?" This is ludicrous--how is it that a few
   hundred musicians and artists responding to a national market
   consisting mostly of white customers suddenly become emblematic of
   black culture or black people?

   Another example involves the drug trade, which in the U.S. is worth
   billions of dollars annually and includes marijuana, heroin, cocaine,
   ecstasy, and crystal meth. It involves people of every race in every
   geographic location and every walk of life. But the street trafficking
   in drugs in large urban areas is largely in the hands of black and
   Latino youth--in substantial part because the only people who would do
   such dangerous, low-paying work are those whose alternative employment
   opportunities are scant. It is no surprise that those incarcerated for
   street-level trafficking are disproportionately blacks. Their arrests
   and imprisonment are not in themselves evidence of racism--or evidence
   of black culture. But given the bare facts of racial stigma in American
   society, many observers will be inclined to think so.

We're All in This Together--at Least We're Supposed to Be

   This point about racial stigma is fundamental. Without understanding
   it, one might say (as many conservative commentators do), "Look at
   recent immigrants from Asia and even from Latin America. They, too,
   have been victims in various ways. Yet they have advanced in our
   society even as the blacks of inner-city Detroit, Chicago,
   Philadelphia, Baltimore, New Orleans, Los Angeles, and Oakland continue
   to lag. Whatever is wrong with those people?" In effect: "It must be
   something about `those people,' not about us, that causes them to be so
   backward."

   By looking at America this way, one eschews social, political, and
   moral responsibility for the plight of those people. One will conclude
   that blacks' failure to develop their human potential reflects the
   absence of such potential (and there are books making that argument),
   or it reflects a backward culture that, sadly but inevitably ("What
   more can we do?") causes them to lag behind. Yet blacks are not the
   authors of the stigma that engenders developmental bias against them.
   When we understand that the way people come to value things or make
   decisions is partly created via interactions in society, their
   flourishing, or lack thereof, reflects on society as a whole, as well
   as on themselves. It reflects on an "us," not merely on "them."

   The mistake is to ignore the extent to which racial inequality reflects
   not only cultural patterns among insular groups of people but also the
   interactions that run through society. To impute a causal role to what
   one takes to be intrinsic cultural traits of a subordinate racial
   group, while failing to see the systemwide context out of which
   dysfunctional cultural patterns emerged, is to commit a significant
   error of social cognition. That members of a particular group seem to
   perform less well routinely on a set of transactions of interest is a
   matter not of a cultural essence but of the network of social relations
   that has (or has not) prepared the members of that group for those
   transactions.

   In the U.S. context, "blackness" is associated with stigmatizing
   meanings. This stigma leads nonblack people to be reluctant to enter
   into intimate social or individual relations with them, which in turn
   affects the social allocation of developmental resources.

   People don't make social judgments based on straightforward
   benefit-cost calculations. Rather, they often act on identity
   considerations. They ask such questions as: Who am I? How should I
   live? With whom should I associate? When should I extend to this
   "other" a benefit of the doubt? Racial inequality is, in substantial
   part, the outcome of a system of nonmarket social interactions such as
   these that entangle us together.

   Consider the high out-of-wedlock birthrates among blacks. This pattern
   of behavior has consequences for socioeconomic racial disparities. But
   that is not the whole story.

   Racial intermarriage rates in the U.S. remain quite low (though they
   have risen in recent decades).[[164]15] The reasons for this low rate
   are unclear. Are black women, perhaps, receiving marriage proposals
   from white men and turning them down? I don't know. But I strongly
   suspect that a low rate of cross-boundary mating between these two
   groups has implications for human development, for resources available
   to children, and for the generation and transmission of wealth.

   Moreover, the low rate of intermarriage has implications for the dating
   and mating market among blacks because they are a small minority of the
   population--roughly one in eight Americans. If white men and black
   women were marrying at a higher rate, black men and black women would
   be interacting in a different way. To observe a social equilibrium in
   which blacks and whites exhibit different out-of-wedlock birthrates
   and, on the basis of that observation, to impute the difference to
   something called black culture, reflects one's failure to see how the
   intra-racial marriage market is nested within a larger context, where a
   higher rate of cross-boundary mating could substantially alter
   intra-boundary behavior.

   What may be perceived as a characteristic of "those people" (Why don't
   they marry? Why do they bear their children in such a disorderly
   manner?) might be seen instead as a question about society as a whole.
   From the perspective of the white population, perhaps the real question
   about out-of-wedlock births is: "Why do we avoid intimacy with them?" I
   use "us," "we," "them" to emphasize how stigma operates. It operates in
   the very definition of who one understands to be the social "we."

   How a society answers the question, "Who are we?" has far-reaching
   implications. When Americans talk about crime, violence, school
   failure, and urban decay, do we understand these matters as "us versus
   them"? If so, it becomes possible to say, regarding people languishing
   in the ghettos of our great cities: "That's not my country. That's some
   third-world thing."

   This was actually said during the flood of New Orleans that followed
   Hurricane Katrina. But black people have been in New Orleans for 250
   years. They're not aliens. They're as American as anybody can be. That
   was us crawling up on the rooftops. That was us huddled in the
   Superdome. The abject poverty that was exposed to a national audience
   after the flood was a quintessentially American affair, not simply a
   measure of the inadequacy of black culture. It reflected as well upon
   our social inadequacy.

   The perspective I am promoting about social capital does not require
   special, race-targeted social policy. Most policy initiatives aimed at
   improving the lives of our most disadvantaged citizens should not, and
   need not, be formulated in explicitly racial terms or understood as a
   remedy for racial injuries. We have to find what works for
   disadvantaged people in America, period. If we get that right--if we
   can fashion an American welfare state consistent with our demographic
   realities, our own values, and our fiscal capacities--we will go a very
   long way toward assisting African-Americans to develop their full human
   potential.

   Finding what works is especially pertinent for education policy.
   Disadvantaged youngsters who live in large cities are poorly served by
   the majority-minority school districts on which they and their parents
   must rely. This is a huge area for policy innovation, with respect to
   charter schools and increased options for parents. Yet black
   politicians who speak publicly on the issue are virtually unanimous in
   adopting the hostility toward charter schools that animates the
   country's largest teachers' union, the National Education Association.
   Thus, at the NAACP's annual board meeting in Cincinnati in 2016,
   delegates were overwhelmed by black American parents who had stormed
   the meeting to protest that the organization's board was about to
   endorse a resolution that opposed more funding for charter schools in
   various states.[[165]16]

   Are police good or bad for the security and safety of black lives in
   U.S. cities? It is hard to imagine a more important question. Yet one
   is hard-pressed to find any effective political debate among
   African-Americans. Instead, we get the shopworn and ineffective stances
   that people on the left are taking.

   Social-justice warriors are supposed to care about black lives. But if
   they did, they'd seriously care about securing the safety and property
   of African-Americans in the South Bronx, the west side of Chicago, and
   other cities. A real argument is to be had over public safety and the
   role of the police, and the answers are far from self-evident. Yet I'm
   not sure that social-justice warriors care about black lives. They seem
   to care more about remaining in lockstep with fashionable liberal
   opinion.

Conclusion: Who Are We?

   How should we think about the persistence of racial inequality in
   America? To deny the relevance of behavioral patterns among some black
   families and communities is folly. To wash one's hands of their
   problems because of such cultural and behavioral impediments is
   profoundly unjust. There are no easy answers, but I suggest that the
   view here is worth considering as a way to account for, and then
   respond to, an enduring dilemma that confronts and frustrates us still.

   Take the poor central-city dwellers who make up perhaps a quarter of
   the African-American population. The dysfunctional behavior of many in
   this population does account for much of their failure to progress--and
   conservatives' demand for greater personal responsibility is necessary
   and proper. Yet, confronted with the despair, violence, and
   self-destructive behavior of so many people, it seems morally
   superficial in the extreme to argue, as many conservatives do, that
   "those people should just get their acts together; if they did, like
   many of the poor immigrants, we would not have such a horrific problem
   in our cities." To the contrary, any morally astute response to the
   social pathology of American history's losers would have to conclude
   that, while we cannot change our ignoble past, we must not be
   indifferent to contemporary suffering issuing directly from that past.
   Their culture may be implicated in their difficulties, but so is our
   culture complicit in their troubles; we bear collective responsibility
   for the form and texture of our social relations.

   While we cannot ignore the behavioral problems of the so-called black
   underclass, we should discuss and react to those problems as if we were
   talking about our own children, neighbors, and friends. It will require
   adjusting ways of thinking on both sides of the racial divide.
   Achieving a well-ordered society, where all members are embraced as
   being among us, should be the goal. Our failure to do so is an American
   tragedy. It is a national, not merely a communal, disgrace. Changing
   the definition of the American "we" is a first step toward rectifying
   the relational discrimination that afflicts our society, and it is the
   best path forward in reducing racial inequality.

Abstract

   There is no safe level of exposure to inorganic arsenic or uranium, yet
   recent studies identified sociodemographic and regional inequalities in
   concentrations of these frequently detected contaminants in public
   water systems across the US. We analyze the county-level association
   between racial/ethnic composition and public water arsenic and uranium
   concentrations from 2000-2011 using geospatial models. We find that
   higher proportions of Hispanic/Latino and American Indian/Alaskan
   Native residents are associated with significantly higher arsenic and
   uranium concentrations. These associations differ in magnitude and
   direction across regions; higher proportions of non-Hispanic Black
   residents are associated with higher arsenic and uranium in regions
   where concentrations of these contaminants are high. The findings from
   this nationwide geospatial analysis identifying racial/ethnic
   inequalities in arsenic and uranium concentrations in public drinking
   water across the US can advance environmental justice initiatives by
   informing regulatory action and financial and technical support to
   protect communities of color.

Introduction

   In some US populations, drinking water is a significant source of
   exposure to inorganic arsenic and uranium, which are major
   environmental exposures associated with cancer, cardiovascular disease
   and other adverse health outcomes^[61]1,[62]2,[63]3,[64]4,[65]5,[66]6.
   Inorganic arsenic (a metalloid) is a known human carcinogen, is
   consistently ranked number one on the Centers for Disease Control and
   Prevention (CDC)/Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry's
   (ATSDR) Substance Priority List^[67]7, and is also associated with
   adverse birth outcomes, diabetes, metabolic disease, and cardiovascular
   disease, even at low- to moderate- levels of exposure common in the US
   population^[68]1,[69]3,[70]4,[71]8. While alpha radiation from uranium
   decay is classified as carcinogenic, growing epidemiologic evidence
   also indicates that uranium exposure is associated with chronic kidney
   disease and is toxic to the respiratory, neurologic, and reproductive
   systems^[72]2,[73]6,[74]9,[75]10. The US Environmental Protection
   Agency (EPA) regulates both arsenic and uranium in US public drinking
   water systems, including community water systems (CWSs) which serve
   over 90% of residents year-round^[76]11. Although the US EPA sets a
   maximum contaminant level (MCL) of 30 ?g/L for uranium and 10 ?g/L for
   arsenic, EPA's non-enforceable maximum contaminant level goal for both
   is 0 ?g/L because there is no known safe level of exposure to either
   inorganic arsenic or uranium (Denmark and the states of New Jersey and
   New Hampshire set more health-protective arsenic MCLs of 5 ?g/L, and
   drinking water providers in the Netherlands adopted a voluntary
   standard of 1 ?g/L in 2016)^[77]12,[78]13,[79]14,[80]15.

   Recent studies indicate that both metals are frequently detected in
   CWSs and significant geographic and sociodemographic inequalities in
   CWS concentrations exist across the US^[81]16,[82]17. CWSs reporting
   the highest concentrations of arsenic and/or uranium were those serving
   communities characterized as Hispanic/Latino or American Indian, those
   located in the Central Midwest or Southwest, those serving incarcerated
   populations in the Southwest, and those reliant on
   groundwater^[83]16,[84]17,[85]18,[86]19. Structural racism likely
   underlies these inequalities in drinking water quality; water
   contaminant exposure disparities are driven by a complex, interactive,
   multilevel system structured around the natural (e.g. hydrogeology,
   climate, soil), built (e.g. agriculture, water infrastructure, land-use
   patterns), and sociopolitical (e.g. regulatory policy, historical
   settlement patterns) environments^[87]20,[88]21,[89]22,[90]23,[91]24.
   These documented disparities in CWS-level arsenic and uranium across
   sociodemographic subgroups underscore the need for robust geospatial
   analyses of community-level racial/ethnic composition and drinking
   water exposures to account for spatial dependency in CWS
   concentrations, which can yield biased effect estimates in traditional
   regression models^[92]25. Previously, nationwide studies evaluating
   these associations were not possible because nationwide estimates of
   contaminant concentrations were not available (distribution boundaries
   are not publicly available for the majority of CWSs). However, our team
   recently developed county-level, population-weighted estimates of
   contaminant concentrations in CWSs across the US for the 2000-2011 time
   period, which were developed from routine compliance monitoring records
   (EPA requires CWSs to routinely monitor for regulated contaminants,
   including arsenic and uranium)^[93]16,[94]17.

   In this study, we examined the county-level association between
   racial/ethnic composition (the proportion of residents belonging to a
   given racial/ethnic group) and CWS arsenic and uranium concentrations
   across the conterminous US using geospatial models. Our objectives were
   to (a) evaluate the county-level distribution and spatial
   autocorrelation of CWS arsenic and uranium, (b) assess the nationwide
   county-level association between racial/ethnic composition and CWS
   arsenic and uranium concentrations in geospatial models, and c)
   quantify the strength, direction, and spatial stationarity of these
   associations at the local level. We specifically assessed geometric
   mean ratios in CWS metal concentrations per 10% higher proportion of
   residents who were non-Hispanic Black, non-Hispanic White,
   Hispanic/Latino, and American Indian/Alaskan Native. We predicted that
   higher proportions of non-Hispanic White residents would be associated
   with lower CWS arsenic and uranium concentrations (likely reflecting
   white supremacy and structural racism related to public drinking water
   infrastructure, investment decisions, and regulatory action that
   specifically benefit non-Hispanic White communities, which have been
   previously documented for some water
   exposures)^[95]23,[96]24,[97]26,[98]27, and that higher proportions of
   Hispanic/Latino and American Indian residents would be associated with
   higher CWS arsenic and uranium concentrations (also consistent with
   previous documented inequalities in public drinking water
   infrastructure and regulatory action across population
   groups)^[99]20,[100]23,[101]28,[102]29. We also anticipated that the
   association between racial/ethnic composition and CWS arsenic and
   uranium concentrations would be unique for each racial/ethnic group and
   would differ in magnitude and direction of the association across
   different regions of the US because of regional differences in
   racial/ethnic composition, geologic context, urban vs rural landscapes,
   and land-use patterns relevant for drinking water arsenic and uranium
   concentrations. As a secondary analysis, we also assessed the
   association between racial/ethnic composition and CWS selenium and
   barium because these metals/metalloids are also regulated in CWSs by
   the EPA, are frequently detected in CWSs, and previous studies found
   significant inequalities in concentrations across sociodemographic and
   regional groups in CWS-level analyses^[103]16 (although the health
   impacts of chronic, low-level exposure to selenium and barium are less
   clear^[104]5,[105]30,[106]31).

   In this work, we show that higher proportions of Hispanic/Latino and
   American Indian/Alaskan Native residents are associated with
   significantly higher CWS arsenic and uranium concentrations at the
   county-level, while higher proportions of non-Hispanic White residents
   are associated with lower CWS arsenic and uranium concentrations. The
   association between racial/ethnic composition and CWS arsenic and
   uranium concentrations differs in magnitude and direction across
   regions; higher proportions of non-Hispanic Black residents is
   associated with higher CWS arsenic and uranium in regions where
   concentrations of these contaminants are high. Findings from this study
   can advance environmental justice initiatives by informing federal and
   state-level infrastructure investments, financial and technical support
   for CWSs, and additional regulatory action to protect communities
   disproportionately exposed to major public drinking water contaminants.

Results

Spatial distribution and clustering of arsenic and uranium in CWSs

   Our analysis uses previously developed, county-level,
   population-weighted concentration estimates of CWS arsenic (2006-2011,
   N = 2585 counties) and uranium (2000-2011, N = 1174
   counties)^[107]16,[108]17. Maps showing the mean concentration
   estimates of county-level CWS arsenic and uranium across the
   conterminous US are presented in Fig. [109]1. Both county-level CWS
   arsenic and uranium exhibited significant positive global spatial
   autocorrelation (Moran's I = 0.62, p value < 0.001 for arsenic, and I =
   0.68, p value < 0.001 for uranium). We next identified specific areas
   of the US where spatial autocorrelation was present by assessing Local
   Indicators of Spatial Association (LISA) clusters. We observed
   significant High-High and Low-Low LISA clusters for both arsenic and
   uranium, which are presented in Fig. [110]1. Areas with High-High
   significant spatial autocorrelation for both arsenic and uranium were
   located in the Midwest and Southwest (e.g. Nevada, California, Arizona,
   New Mexico, Texas, Kansas, Nebraska) where CWS arsenic and uranium
   concentrations are highest in underlying
   groundwater^[111]16,[112]17,[113]32. Low-Low clusters for arsenic were
   identified in the Southeast and Mid-Atlantic regions (e.g. Alabama,
   Arkansas, North and South Carolina, Virginia, Kentucky). Low-Low
   clusters for uranium were located in similar geographic areas, although
   spatial coverage was poorer in the eastern US. We also identified
   significant positive spatial autocorrelation for barium and selenium
   (Supplementary Fig. [114]1).

County-level sociodemographic characteristics and metal concentrations

   Because we restricted our analysis of each racial/ethnic group to
   counties with at least 100 residents of that group to avoid positivity
   violations^[117]33 (i.e., the number of residents in a given
   racial/ethnic subgroup should be greater than zero for all counties
   analyzed or effect estimates would be extrapolated beyond the range of
   actual values), the number of counties included in the analysis of each
   racial/ethnic group differed (see Methods setion: Exclusion criteria).
   Across the counties included in each racial/ethnic analysis and all
   counties included in any analysis (N = 2653), we first described mean
   county-level CWS arsenic and uranium concentrations, racial/ethnic
   composition, and other county-level characteristics of interest
   (Table [118]1). Nationwide, the county-level mean percentage of
   residents belonging to each racial/ethnic group was 7% (non-Hispanic
   Black), 2% (American Indian/Alaskan Native), 9% (Hispanic/Latino), and
   80% (non-Hispanic White). In analyses for each racial/ethnic group, we
   evaluated a total of 1881 (non-Hispanic Black), 1575 (American
   Indian/Alaskan Native), 2401 (Hispanic/Latino), and 2653 (non-Hispanic
   White) counties. Compared to counties included in any analysis,
   counties included in the analysis for non-Hispanic Black residents had
   lower mean CWS arsenic (1.17 ?g/L vs. 1.42 ?g/L) and uranium (2.5 ?g/L
   vs. 3.45 ?g/L) concentrations, a lower percentage of CWSs reliant on
   groundwater, and a lower percentage of the population living in rural
   areas. Counties included in the analysis for American Indian/Alaskan
   Native residents had larger population size and density and the lowest
   percentage of the population living in rural areas. Counties included
   in the analysis for Hispanic/Latino residents had higher mean CWS
   uranium (3.38 ?g/L vs. 3.45 ?g/L) concentrations. No counties were
   excluded for having <100 residents in the analysis for non-Hispanic
   White residents, and therefore these counties are the same as all
   counties included in any analysis.
   Table 1 County-level mean estimated community water system (CWS) metal
   concentrations and sociodemographic characteristics for all counties
   included in any analysis (N = 2631 counties), and separately for
   counties included in analyses specific to each racial/ethnic group
   (counties with >100 residents of each racial/ethnic group)

Spatial lag regression

   To identify nationwide inequalities in CWS arsenic and uranium by
   racial/ethnic composition, we quantified the association between
   county-level racial/ethnic composition and CWS arsenic and uranium
   separately for each of the four racial/ethnic groups using spatial lag
   regression models with an autoregressive correlation structure to
   account for spatial dependence (see Methods section: Statistical
   analysis: spatial lag regression)^[120]34. We evaluated the geometric
   mean ratios (GMRs) and corresponding percent differences in CWS arsenic
   and uranium concentrations per a 10 percent higher proportion of
   residents belonging to each racial/ethnic group in progressively
   adjusted models (Table [121]2).
   Table 2 Geometric mean ratios (95% CI) of county-level community water
   system (CWS) arsenic and uranium concentrations per a 10 percent higher
   proportion of non-Hispanic Black, American Indian/Alaskan Native,
   Hispanic/Latino, and non-Hispanic White residents, from spatial lag
   regression models
   [122]Full size table

   Our main model of interest (Model 1) adjusted for population density,
   the percent of public drinking water sourced from groundwater supplies,
   median household income, and the percent of adults with a high school
   diploma. Effect estimates were considered statistically significant
   when 95% confidence intervals did not cross the null (GMR of 1 and
   percent change of 0). In fully adjusted models (Model 1), the percent
   increase in the geometric mean (95% CI) of CWS metal concentrations per
   10% higher proportion of Hispanic/Latino residents was 6% (4, 8) for
   arsenic and 17% (13, 22) for uranium. For a 10% higher proportion of
   American Indian/Alaskan Native residents, the percent increase in the
   geometric mean (95% CI) of CWS metal concentration was 7% (3, 11) for
   arsenic and 2% (-4, 8) for uranium. For a 10% higher proportion of
   non-Hispanic Black residents, the percent decrease in the geometric
   mean (95% CI) of CWS metal concentration was 8% (10, 6) for arsenic and
   9% (13, 5) for uranium. The percent decrease in the geometric mean (95%
   CI) of CWS metal concentrations for a 10% higher proportion of
   non-Hispanic White residents was 1% (2, 0) for arsenic and 5% (8, 3)
   for uranium. Models further adjusting for the composition of other
   racial/ethnic groups yielded similar results (Model 2).

   We performed several sensitivity analyses, all with similar findings.
   Adjusting for the CDC/ATSDR's county-level index of socioeconomic
   status^[123]35 (rather than median household income and the percent of
   adults with a high school education) yielded similar findings,
   supporting that the adjustment for income and education in Model 1
   (derived from our conceptual framework in Supplementary Fig. [124]1)
   was able to capture socioeconomic status. We conducted several
   additional sensitivity analyses that also yielded robust findings,
   including: further adjustment for the total number of non-Hispanic
   White residents, using county-level 95th percentile CWS arsenic and
   uranium concentrations (rather than the mean), assessing higher
   proportions of residents in a given racial/ethnic group corresponding
   to the interquartile range and 60% (rather than 10%), without
   adjustment for population density, and after restriction to counties in
   the western US where CWS arsenic and uranium are highest (see Methods:
   Statistical analysis: spatial lag regression and Supplementary
   Table [125]1). As a complementary analysis to our assessment of higher
   proportions of non-Hispanic White residents, we also assessed the
   association per a 10% higher proportion of all residents who were not
   categorized as non-Hispanic White, including non-Hispanic Black,
   American Indian/Alaskan Native, Hispanic/Latino, non-Hispanic Asian,
   Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander, and all residents in other
   racial/ethnic categories. For a 10% higher proportion of these
   residents (all residents who were not categorized as non-Hispanic
   White), the percent increase in the geometric mean (95% CI) was 1% (-1,
   3) for arsenic and 10% (6, 14) for uranium (results are shown in
   Supplementary Table [126]2). Because this association persisted even
   after combining all residents not categorized as non-Hispanic White,
   these complementary findings support the general hypothesis and leading
   theoretical framework on water exposure disparities- that white
   supremacy and structural racism are associated with drinking water
   inequalities^[127]23. However, the specific mechanisms underlying these
   disparities (e.g., infrastructure investments or management decisions
   specifically benefiting non-Hispanic White communities, etc.) are
   beyond the scope of this analysis. Findings were also similar for
   barium and selenium (Supplementary Table [128]3).

Geographically weighted regression

   To assess local inequalities in CWS arsenic and uranium by
   racial/ethnic composition we next explored the strength and direction
   of the association between racial/ethnic composition and CWS arsenic
   and uranium, and evaluated spatial non-stationarity in the effect
   estimates via geographically weighted regression models (see Methods
   section: Statistical analysis: Geographically weighted regression).
   County-specific coefficients from the geographically weighted
   regression analysis for each racial/ethnic group and CWS arsenic and
   uranium are displayed in Figs. [129]2 and [130]3, respectively. County
   colors represent the magnitude of the local GMR of CWS metals for a 10%
   higher proportion of residents in each specified racial/ethnic group,
   with positive associations (GMR > 1) displayed in red and inverse (GMR
   < 1) associations displayed in blue. Positive associations imply that
   the CWS metal concentrations are higher in the county than predicted
   from the regression model, potentially due to local-scale
   heterogeneity.

   in black and white) are available in Supplementary Fig. [135]8.
   [136]Full size image

   We observed spatial non-stationarity in the associations between
   racial/ethnic composition and CWS metal concentrations for all
   racial/ethnic groups for both arsenic and uranium, with different
   associations at the local level for each racial/ethnic group. Although
   the GMRs of CWS metal concentrations per a 10 percent higher proportion
   of non-Hispanic Black residents were inverse in nationwide spatial lag
   regression models (Table [137]2), geographically weighted regression
   indicated a positive association for CWS arsenic and uranium in areas
   where these CWS concentrations are high (particularly in the southwest,
   see Fig. [138]1). This was particularly evident for arsenic in western
   Texas, Arizona, California, Nevada, Utah, Oregon, and Washington, and
   for uranium in Arizona, California, Nevada, Oregon, and Oklahoma where
   we observed positive associations of higher magnitude (Figs. [139]2 and
   [140]3). Similarly, we observed a positive association between higher
   proportions of American Indian/Alaskan Native residents and CWS arsenic
   and uranium in the Northern Plains and in the west, particularly across
   Oregon, Washington, Montana, North Dakota and South Dakota, Minnesota,
   and Wisconsin for arsenic, and California, Nevada, Oregon, North
   Dakota, and Wisconsin for uranium. Findings for Hispanic/Latino
   residents were more consistent with findings from global spatial lag
   models, with significant, positive associations between higher
   proportions of Hispanic/Latino residents and CWS arsenic and uranium
   across most of the conterminous US. As anticipated, we observed higher
   model goodness-of-fit in areas with higher CWS metal concentrations and
   better spatial coverage of CWS arsenic and uranium estimates
   (Supplementary Figs. [141]3 and [142]4). Associations and
   goodness-of-fit for selenium and barium also differed locally and are
   presented in Supplementary Figs. [143]5 and [144]6.

Discussion

   Our study provides new evidence that racial/ethnic composition is
   associated with public drinking water arsenic and uranium
   concentrations, adding to a growing body of literature characterizing
   nationwide environmental and racial injustices in US public drinking
   water
   contaminants^[145]16,[146]17,[147]18,[148]19,[149]20,[150]26,[151]27,[1
   52]28,[153]29. Although our analysis was informed by a strong
   conceptual framework (see Supplementary Fig. [154]1) and other
   previously well-developed frameworks describing how disparities in
   drinking water exposures result from structural and environmental
   racism^[155]20,[156]21,[157]22,[158]23,[159]24, our study is
   descriptive in nature and is not intended to identify mechanisms by
   which racial/ethnic public water concentration disparities were created
   or reinforced.

   As predicted, nationwide analyses indicated that a higher proportion of
   non-Hispanic White residents was associated with lower CWS arsenic and
   uranium, while a higher proportion of Hispanic/Latino and American
   Indian/Alaskan Native residents was associated with higher CWS arsenic
   and uranium. These findings remained robust across several sensitivity
   analyses considering alternative adjustment approaches and alternative
   magnitudes of change in racial/ethnic composition, and are also
   consistent with previous studies utilizing non-geospatial approaches at
   the water system level^[160]20,[161]26,[162]29. These findings likely
   reflect structural environmental racism and white supremacy and
   privilege.

   Structural racism refers to the "totality of ways in which societies
   foster racialdiscrimination, through mutually reinforcing inequitable
   systems (in housing, education, employment, earnings, benefits, credit,
   media, health care, criminal justice, and so on)"^[163]36,[164]37.
   Structural racism serves to maintain white supremacy, in part, by
   amassing resources for and benefiting white communities to the
   detriment of communities of color^[165]38,[166]39,[167]40. Extensive
   research in the fields of sociology and epidemiology support that
   racism is a fundamental cause of disease and producer of health
   inequalities across racial/ethnic groups^[168]41,[169]42,[170]43.
   Structural racism produces health inequalities for marginalized
   communities through numerous mechanisms, including through the creation
   and perpetuation of inequalities in toxic environmental exposures,
   social determinants of health, and other psychosocial
   stressors^[171]36,[172]37,[173]39,[174]44,[175]45,[176]46. Prior
   studies identifying the specific mechanisms underlying water
   inequalities are abundant, although responsible mechanisms differ
   across contaminants, geographic regions, and the sociodemographic
   characteristics of impacted communities. Briefly, previous studies have
   identified community linguistic isolation, selective enforcement of
   drinking water regulations, the underbounding of communities of color
   from municipal boundaries and water services, and the direct
   withholding of resources and infrastructure investments as examples of
   mechanisms responsible for producing and maintaining inequalities in
   exposure to regulated drinking water
   contaminants^[177]23,[178]26,[179]47,[180]48,[181]49. For example,
   inequalities in public water lead exposure are related to changes in
   water supply sources, corrosion control, service line infrastructure
   investments, and targeted tap sampling for compliance
   monitoring^[182]32,[183]50,[184]51,[185]52,[186]53. Similar mechanisms
   may underlie the unequal distribution of arsenic and uranium
   concentrations in CWS observed in this study, although additional
   research is needed to evaluate those mechanisms in detail.

   Consistent with our other prediction that these associations would
   differ across geographic regions due to underlying geologic context,
   (i.e., water metal concentrations are influenced by natural composition
   of rocks and soil, and anthropogenic contamination from industrial
   activity, mining, agriculture)^[187]2,[188]3,[189]5 we found larger
   effect estimates from geographically weighted regression models in the
   southwestern US where water arsenic and uranium are high, and smaller
   effect estimates in other regions where these concentrations of these
   contaminants are low (i.e., the southeast). Taken together, these
   findings also suggest that communities with higher proportions of
   Hispanic/Latino and American Indian/Alaskan Native residents may be
   served by public water systems with elevated concentrations of other
   contaminants that were not evaluated in the present study, especially
   for contaminants that are present at meaningful concentrations in the
   geographic area.

   There are several potential explanations for the observed inverse
   relationship between the proportion of non-Hispanic Black residents and
   CWS arsenic and uranium concentrations in nationwide analyses. First,
   nationwide, non-Hispanic Black residents are more likely to live in
   urban areas^[190]54,[191]55, and therefore may be more likely served by
   large urban CWSs which have higher economies of scale and can implement
   more health protective water treatment systems and decisions. Cities
   with higher proportions of non-Hispanic Black residents are also more
   likely located in the eastern and southeastern US, where CWS arsenic
   concentrations are low. Although the majority of Hispanic/Latino
   residents also live in urban areas, these residents are also more
   likely to live in the southwestern US where groundwater arsenic and
   uranium concentrations are naturally high^[192]19,[193]56,[194]57. This
   explanation is supported by our findings from geographically weighted
   regression (Figs. [195]2 and [196]3) and the analyses restricted to
   western counties (Supplementary Table [197]1), which indicated that a
   higher proportion of non-Hispanic Black residents was associated with
   higher CWS arsenic and uranium in the southwest, but not in the
   southeast where arsenic and uranium water concentrations are low
   (Fig. [198]1). These findings suggest that racial/ethnic inequalities
   in public water contaminant exposures may be more likely or more severe
   in geographic regions with both a high percentage of public water users
   of the specified racial/ethnic group and relatively high concentrations
   of specific contaminants in source water. Additional public water
   contaminants beyond metals should be also assessed, as these will
   likely display different nationwide geographic patterns which may
   overlap with areas where a majority of residents are non-Hispanic
   Black^[199]23,[200]24. Future studies should assess these differences
   in analyses stratified by urban/rural areas to evaluate these potential
   explanations. Additionally, in areas of the US where non-Hispanic Black
   and American Indian communities rely heavily on private wells (the
   rural southeast and the rural Great Plains and southwest,
   respectively), public water systems may predominantly serve
   non-Hispanic White residents. Therefore, it is possible that the
   current analysis may underestimate the impact of community
   racial/ethnic composition on public water arsenic and uranium for both
   non-Hispanic Black and American Indian communities in these particular
   areas.

   Across all analyses, our findings were largely consistent for arsenic
   and uranium, likely reflecting the clustering and co-occurrence of
   arsenic and uranium in public water systems which has been previously
   described in detail^[201]16. The co-occurrence of arsenic and uranium
   has been documented in both regulated and unregulated water
   supplies^[202]16,[203]19,[204]32,[205]58,[206]59, and may be related to
   carbonate complexes increasing the solubility of arsenic and uranium,
   and/or the presence of bicarbonate ions in oxic water sources
   (bicarbonate ions may be especially relevant for the continued
   co-occurrence of arsenic and uranium in treated
   water)^[207]60,[208]61,[209]62.

   Our findings are particularly relevant to public health because there
   is no safe level of exposure to inorganic arsenic and
   uranium^[210]2,[211]3. At moderate to high levels of exposure,
   inorganic arsenic is associated with a number of adverse health
   outcomes including diabetes, lung disease, neurologic effects, kidney
   disease, and birth outcomes including low birth weight and impaired
   neurodevelopment; inorganic arsenic is also associated with
   cardiovascular disease and increased oxidative stress even at low to
   moderate exposure levels common in the US
   population^[212]1,[213]5,[214]63,[215]64,[216]65,[217]66. Uranium
   exposure is associated with kidney disease, including kidney cancer,
   and neurologic and cardiovascular disease, although evidence for other
   adverse health outcomes is more
   limited^[218]2,[219]6,[220]9,[221]10,[222]67. Although the effect
   estimates described in the current study are small to modest, their
   public health implications may be substantial when considered across
   the entire population. Several studies have identified disparities in
   health outcomes across racial/ethnic groups that are related to uranium
   and arsenic exposure. For example, American Indian/Alaskan Native
   populations experience substantially higher rates of kidney cancer
   compared to non-Hispanic White populations, especially in the
   Southwestern US where uranium exposures and co-exposures to arsenic and
   other metal mixtures are relatively high as a result of the uranium
   mining activity that occurred over the past
   century^[223]19,[224]58,[225]59,[226]68. For example, the mean uranium
   concentration in urine (biomarker of internal dose) among pregnant
   women living in the American Indian Reservations in the Southwest is
   2.67-2.8 times higher compared to the general US population^[227]69.

   Our study has several limitations. First, our nationwide evaluation of
   the county-level association between racial/ethnic composition and CWS
   metal concentrations may mask associations operating at finer
   geographic resolutions (e.g. within states, or across Census blocks or
   zip-codes)^[228]21,[229]70. We were not able to evaluate these
   associations at finer geographic resolutions because nationwide CWS
   concentration estimates are not yet available at these levels of
   aggregation (there is currently no publicly available, nationwide map
   of public drinking water system distribution boundaries that can be
   used to generate concentration estimates at these resolutions). Future
   studies at smaller spatial scales and with finer geographic resolution
   may also address the substantial differences in county size across the
   US. Larger county sizes may lead to larger measurement error, which may
   especially impact findings in the western US compared to the eastern US
   where counties areas are smaller. One recent study at the Census-block
   level in California also found significant associations between higher
   proportions of residents of color and drinking water arsenic
   concentrations, suggesting that these associations are likely also
   present for other states in the southwestern US^[230]71. Although some
   studies have evaluated sociodemographic characteristics of the
   "city-served" by CWSs, which is reported in the US EPA's Safe Drinking
   Water Information System (SDWIS), approximately half of all public
   water systems did not report "city-served" in SDWIS^[231]24,[232]72. In
   future studies, available water system distribution maps can be used to
   determine if "city-served" as reported in SDWIS provides a reasonable
   approximation of water system distribution boundaries nationwide.

   Second, although our nationwide, county-level analysis was intended to
   minimize selection bias, we restricted our analyses to counties with at
   least 100 residents in the racial/ethnic group of interest to avoid
   positivity violations, and this may have introduced selection bias.
   Counties excluded from analysis under this criterion had smaller
   population sizes, lower population densities, a higher percentage of
   residents living in rural areas, higher proportions of non-Hispanic
   White residents, and higher CWS arsenic and uranium concentrations
   (Supplementary Table [233]4). We did not assess associations for Asian
   and Native Hawaiian or Pacific Islander groups because no counties had
   >60% of residents for these groups. Future analyses can assess these
   associations at finer geographic resolutions, restricted to areas with
   larger populations of interest. We relied on Census bridged race
   categorized data, which does not capture several domains of
   racial/ethnic composition and could lead to misclassification. In
   addition, our analyses for uranium were limited by the relatively poor
   spatial coverage in CWS uranium concentration estimates, especially for
   the eastern and southeastern US. The CWS uranium concentrations used
   here are based on the most recently available CWS uranium monitoring
   records made publicly available by EPA, and are to our knowledge the
   most complete estimates currently available. Future studies can improve
   upon these estimates when EPA releases additional compliance monitoring
   records for the Fourth Six Year Review (expected 2023).

   Future studies should also evaluate the association between
   racial/ethnic segregation and inequalities in CWS metal concentration
   estimates, especially because prior analyses of noise exposure^[234]70
   and air pollution^[235]21,[236]73,[237]74 indicate that racial/ethnic
   segregation is associated with exposure inequalities. Geographically
   weighted regression indicated a positive association between larger
   proportions of non-Hispanic Black residents and CWS arsenic in parts of
   west Texas and the Midwest. These findings suggest that additional
   analyses at a finer geographic resolution should focus specifically on
   these particularly vulnerable geographic areas where metals in CWSs and
   soil are particularly high (public water system distribution boundaries
   are also publicly available for many of these states). Future analyses
   should also assess whether changes in racial/ethnic composition and
   migration patterns over time are associated with changes in CWS arsenic
   and uranium concentrations over time.

   Current US public drinking water infrastructure, management, and
   regulatory action does not adequately protect communities of color from
   elevated contaminant exposures. Recent federal infrastructure
   investment proposals have suggested targeting financial and technical
   support to small public water systems in rural and tribal areas, which
   experience substantial difficulties in achieving lower contaminant
   concentrations^[238]75. Findings from our current study add to a
   mounting body of evidence supporting that financial and technical
   support, infrastructure investments, and regulatory action must be
   directed towards supporting communities with larger populations of
   American Indian/Alaskan Native, Hispanic/Latino, and non-Hispanic Black
   residents. Given the known inequalities in public drinking water lead
   exposure for non-Hispanic Black communities across the US, specific and
   additional financial and technical support should also be directed to
   public water systems serving these communities to reduce elevated water
   concentrations and associated health outcomes. Racial/ethnic
   inequalities in public drinking water arsenic and uranium
   concentrations are unacceptable, and further research is needed to
   identify the specific mechanisms by which structural racism is
   operating to result in concentration inequalities for multiple
   regulated drinking water contaminants.

Methods

County-level public drinking water metal concentrations

   We utilized previously developed, county-level, population-weighted
   concentration estimates of arsenic, uranium, selenium, and barium
   concentrations in CWSs across the US, which were previously developed
   and described in detail^[239]17. These concentration estimates are
   based on the most recent publicly available nationwide monitoring data
   for public water systems. Briefly, county-level CWS metal concentration
   estimates were developed using routine compliance monitoring records
   compiled by the US Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) for the
   National Contaminant Occurrence Database supporting the Second and
   Third Six Year Review (SYR)^[240]76. The SYR database contains routine
   compliance monitoring records voluntarily submitted to EPA by primacy
   agencies including states and tribal authorities^[241]77,[242]78. CWS
   metal concentrations were averaged within a six-year period (2006-2011)
   for arsenic, selenium, and barium and within an eleven-year period
   (2000-2011) for uranium. These three- and eleven-year averages yield
   unbiased concentration estimates by accounting for the different
   compliance monitoring periods defined by EPA's Standardized Monitoring
   Framework requirements for arsenic (regulated under the Chemical
   Contaminants Rule and the Final Arsenic Rule) and for uranium
   (regulated under the Radionuclides Rule)^[243]17. Average metal
   concentrations at the county-level were calculated by weighing the
   average concentration for each CWS within the county by the size of the
   population served by each CWS. County-level CWS metal averages are
   missing when a) no compliance monitoring records were submitted for
   that county to the SYR, or b) CWSs serving that county reported serving
   <50% of the public-water reliant population in the entire
   county^[244]17. All county-level CWS metal variables were right skewed
   and natural log-transformed for analysis.

County-level racial/ethnic composition and sociodemographic data

   County-level racial/ethnic composition variables were derived from 2010
   US Census Population Estimates and included the proportion of residents
   who are American Indian or Alaskan Native (hereafter referred to as
   American Indian/Alaskan Native), non-Hispanic Asian, Native Hawaiian or
   Other Pacific Islander, Hispanic or Latino (hereafter referred to as
   Hispanic/Latino), non-Hispanic Black or African American (hereafter
   referred to as non-Hispanic Black), and non-Hispanic White. We selected
   sociodemographic variables from time periods that overlapped with the
   time period of the CWS arsenic and uranium concentration estimates
   (2006-2011). The percent of adults with a high school diploma was
   derived from the 2007-2011 US Census American Community Survey. Median
   household income was derived from the 2011 Small Area Income and
   Poverty Estimates and 2010-2011 National Center for Education
   Statistics data. We also downloaded the CDC/ATSDR's 2014 county-level
   index for socioeconomic status, which we adjusted for in sensitivity
   analyses rather than adjusting for median household income and the
   percent of adults with a high school diploma (the CDC's county-level
   index for socioeconomic status is a rank-order index for all counties
   in the US based on the percent of adults living below the federal
   poverty line, the percent of unemployed adults, median household
   income, and the percent of adults without a high school
   diploma)^[245]35. Although other variables which reflect socioeconomic
   status were available and are likely related to both racial/ethnic
   composition and CWS metal concentrations (such as the percent of the
   population living in rural areas, the percent of residents without
   health insurance, percent unemployment, percent of children eligible
   for free lunch, and percent of children living below poverty level),
   these variables did not open biasing paths on our conceptual diagram
   (Supplementary Fig. [246]1), and we therefore did not adjust for them.
   County total population and population density (population per square
   mile) were also retrieved from the 2010 US Census. We estimated the
   percent of public drinking water supplied by groundwater sources
   (versus surface water sources) from estimates of total groundwater and
   surface water withdrawn for public drinking water calculated by the US
   Geological Survey for 2010 (we used 2015 estimates for 20 counties
   which were missing estimates in 2010; the Spearman correlation
   coefficient between estimates for the two years was
   0.93)^[247]56,[248]57. A full description of all county-level variables
   used in this analysis is available in Supplementary Table [249]5. All
   data management and analysis were conducted in R version 4.0.3, except
   the assessment of spatial autocorrelation which was conducted in GeoDa
   version 1.18.0. For visualization, maps were generated in QGIS version
   3.10.

Exclusion criteria

   We restricted our analysis to conterminous US counties/county
   equivalents (N = 3158) because counties in Alaska and Hawaii have few
   neighboring counties and unique geological contexts impacting water
   contaminant concentrations. We further excluded 473 counties that did
   not have CWS concentration estimates available for either arsenic or
   uranium, 34 counties missing the percent of public drinking water
   supplied by groundwater sources, and 20 counties missing the percent of
   adults with a high school diploma. The county level CWS metal
   concentration estimates and sociodemographic characteristics for
   counties excluded from our analyses are presented in (Supplementary
   Table [250]4). After these exclusions, the total number of counties
   with CWS metal concentration estimates available was N = 2585 for
   arsenic and N = 1174 for uranium. No counties were missing
   racial/ethnic composition variables. We further restricted our analysis
   to assessing the association between county-level racial/ethnic
   composition and public drinking water metal concentrations for the
   proportion of non-Hispanic Black, American Indian/Alaskan Native,
   Hispanic/Latino, and non-Hispanic White residents. Analyses were
   conducted separately for each of the five racial/ethnic groups. We
   further restricted our analyses to counties with at least 100 residents
   in the racial/ethnic group of interest because very small population
   numbers could violate positivity assumptions (i.e., for some counties,
   the proportion of residents of a given racial/ethnic group would be
   zero or very near zero, and therefore effect estimates would be
   extrapolated beyond the range of actual values), or bias results if
   small increases in the absolute number of residents resulted in large
   percentage differences^[251]33. We selected 100 as the cut-point
   assuming most public water systems serve at least 25 households with an
   average of four residents per household (EPA defines public water
   systems as those that serve at least 15 service connections or 25
   people at least 60 days per year)^[252]79. We did not evaluate
   associations for the proportion of non-Hispanic Asian and Native
   Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander residents because no conterminous US
   counties had >60% of residents in these categories, a common cut-point
   to identify racial/ethnic majority areas in prior literature^[253]80.

Statistical analysis: descriptive data analysis

   To describe sociodemographic differences and differences in public
   drinking water metal concentrations across all counties in our analysis
   versus the counties included in the analysis for each racial/ethnic
   group, we described mean county-level CWS arsenic and uranium,
   concentrations, population size, population density, the percent of
   public drinking water supplied from groundwater sources, median
   household income, the percent of residents with a high school diploma,
   the percent of the population living in rural areas, and racial/ethnic
   composition across these county categories and presented them in
   Table [254]1. We also compared these characteristics across counties
   that were excluded from analysis to assess potential selection bias
   (Supplementary Table [255]4).

Statistical analysis: assessing spatial clustering

   We first explored spatial autocorrelation (spatial dependence) in
   county-level CWS metal concentration estimates across the US. We used a
   simple contiguity first order queen weighting matrix with binary values
   identifying neighbors (i = 1) and non-neighbors (i = 0). Counties with
   no neighbors were excluded. We evaluated the county-level association
   between the five racial/ethnic composition variables and CWS mean
   arsenic and uranium concentrations in 8 separate ordinary least squares
   (OLS) linear models, regressing each CWS metal on each of the four
   racial/ethnic composition variables (proportion of non-Hispanic Black,
   American Indian/Alaskan Native, Hispanic/Latino, and non-Hispanic White
   residents). To assess global spatial autocorrelation, we visually
   assessed the residuals from each OLS model and assessed Moran's I
   residual scatterplots and statistics for each CWS metal. The Moran's I
   statistic is the coefficient of best fit associated with the OLS line
   of best fit for each local unit's (i) standardized value plotted
   against the local unit's identified neighborhood (j) standardized
   average value of CWS metal concentration. To assess local spatial
   autocorrelation, we examined Local Indicators of Spatial Association
   (LISA) statistics, where every local unit's (I[i]) LISA score is the
   product of the standardized units' value (z[i]) relative to the average
   standard local values, multiplied by the sum of the weight matrix value
   times the neighborhood average value^[256]80.

Statistical analysis: spatial lag regression

   Because OLS residuals, Moran's I scatterplots, and Moran's I statistics
   (p < 0.001) all indicated global spatial autocorrelation for arsenic
   and uranium, and ignoring spatial autocorrelation violates assumptions
   of independence and can bias effect estimates^[257]34, we further
   assessed whether a spatial error or spatial lag model was most
   appropriate for our data using the Lagrange (Lag) Multiplier
   diagnostics function (lm.LMtest) in R using the package "spatialreg". A
   significant spatial lag or error term indicate that the residuals
   across spatial locations are correlated. Both the spatial lag and
   spatial error models returned p-values < 0.001, but we concluded that
   the spatial lag model was preferable to the spatial error model because
   the model estimates were larger^[258]81. A description of these
   diagnostic assessments for the OLS and spatial lag regression models
   are available in Supplementary Table [259]6.

   To quantify the association between county-level racial/ethnic
   composition and CWS metal concentrations, we evaluated spatial lag
   regression models with an autoregressive correlation structure
   separately for CWS arsenic and uranium concentrations and for each of
   the five racial/ethnic composition variables in R using the lagsarlm
   function from the "spatialreg" package^[260]82. We assessed the
   geometric mean ratio (GMR) and corresponding percent difference of CWS
   arsenic and uranium concentrations per 10% higher proportion of
   residents classified as non-Hispanic Black, American Indian/Alaskan
   Native, Hispanic/Latino, and non-Hispanic White. Fully adjusted models
   (Model 1) were adjusted for population density, the percent of public
   drinking water sourced from groundwater supplies, median household
   income, the percent of adults with a high school diploma. Model 2
   further adjusted for the proportion of the other racial/ethnic groups
   except for the proportion of non-Hispanic White residents. This
   "leave-one-out" modeling approach is useful when proportional variables
   sum to nearly 100% and higher proportions of one component occur
   simultaneously with lower proportions of at least one other component
   (this approach has been used in studies assessing arsenic metabolism,
   cell type ratios, and nutritional epidemiology)^[261]83. An example of
   the interpretation of the coefficient of interest from these models is
   as follows: in models assessing the proportion of Hispanic/Latino
   residents as the primary exposure, the coefficient for the proportion
   of Hispanic/Latino residents estimates the geometric mean ratio of CWS
   metal concentrations per 10% higher proportion of Hispanic/Latino
   residents because the proportion of non-Hispanic White residents is
   lower, controlling for the proportion of non-Hispanic Black and
   American Indian/Alaskan Native residents. We selected non-Hispanic
   White as the "leave-one-out" group because structural racism privileges
   and benefits this population group and we predicted that counties with
   lower proportions of these residents would have higher CWS metal
   concentrations. Because effect estimates from Model 1 and Model 2 were
   very similar, we selected the more parsimonious Model 1 as the main
   model of interest.

   We performed several sensitivity analyses. First, we repeated the
   analyses adjusting for Model 1 covariates and the total number of
   non-Hispanic White residents, with similar findings (results not
   shown). Second, we repeated the analyses using the county-level
   weighted 95^th percentile public drinking water metal concentrations
   (instead of the natural log-mean estimates), with similar findings
   although effect estimates were generally stronger (results not shown).
   Third, we repeated the analyses by assessing the geometric mean ratio
   of CWS arsenic and uranium per change in the proportion of a given
   racial/ethnic group that corresponds to (a) a 60% higher proportion of
   residents, a common cut-point to identify racial/ethnic majority areas
   in prior literature^[262]80, and (b) the value corresponding to the
   interquartile range for the proportion of residents in the specified
   racial/ethnic group, with similar findings for both approaches
   (Supplementary Table [263]1). Fourth, we repeated the spatial lag
   regression evaluating the association for higher proportions of
   American Indian/Alaskan Native residents without adjusting for
   population density because many communities and counties with a large
   proportion of these residents have relatively low population density
   (effect estimates for both arsenic and uranium were similar but
   stronger, results not shown). Fifth, we repeated our analyses after
   restricting to counties in the western US where county-level CWS
   arsenic and uranium estimates are highest (we defined the western US as
   Washington, Oregon, Idaho, Montana, Wyoming, North Dakota, South
   Dakota, Nebraska, Kansas, Oklahoma, Texas, New Mexico, Colorado, Utah,
   Arizona, Nevada, and California). Analyses restricted to western US
   generally yield similar findings although positive associations were
   identified for 10% higher proportions of non-Hispanic Black residents
   and uranium. However, these findings were limited by the small sample
   size (n = 296 counties; Supplementary Table [264]1). Finally, to
   complement our analyses assessing higher proportions of non-Hispanic
   White residents, we assessed the associations per a 10% higher
   proportion of all residents who were not categorized as non-Hispanic
   White, including non-Hispanic Black, American Indian/Alaskan Native,
   Hispanic/Latino, non-Hispanic Asian, Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific
   Islander, and all residents in other racial/ethnic categories. This
   sensitivity analysis is specifically intended to evaluate the
   prediction that higher proportions of non-Hispanic White residents is
   associated with lower CWS metal concentrations.

Statistical analysis: geographically weighted regression

   To explore the strength and direction of the association between
   county-level racial/ethnic composition and CWS arsenic and uranium
   concentrations and evaluate spatial non-stationarity in the effect
   estimates, we conducted geographically weighted regression using the
   "GWmodel" package in R version 4.0.3^[265]84. Geographically weighted
   regression models are exploratory, Gaussian-like, distance-based models
   that incorporate a spatial weighting function, combine geographic and
   attribute information, and obtain location-specific results. This
   approach provides a different regression output for each individual
   county, which allow us to assess variation across space in both (a) the
   magnitude and direction of the effect of racial/ethnic composition on
   CWS metal concentration, and (b) model goodness-of-fit. We ran separate
   geographically weighted regression models reproducing the separate
   models for CWS arsenic and uranium and for each of the four
   racial/ethnic groups that we previously assessed with global spatial
   lag regression models. Models were fully adjusted for population
   density, the percent of public drinking water sourced from groundwater
   supplies, median household income, and the percent of adults with a
   high school diploma (Model 1).

   racialdiscrimination panel discussion insights 21 march event

racialdiscrimination in Sweden and the United States - March 21 Follow up
content

     [50]March 29, 2021January 20, 2022

Continue to explore racialdiscrimination issues in Sweden and the United
States through our additional content

   On March 21st The Raoul Wallenberg together with Kino organised the
   [51]second event of the Swedish Human Rights Film Festival. We marked
   the International Day for the Elimination of racialdiscrimination with
   a panel discussion on racialdiscrimination in Sweden and the US. Aysha
   Jones, Founder of the Black Lives Matter and Irene Molina, Pr. in Human
   Geography at Uppsala University offered us their views on this very
   topical subject.

   Feel free to watch the event and read about its main insights [52]here.

   In addition, the Institute would like to continue the conversation with
   you and explore more in depth this topic. You can therefore find below
   interviews and podcasts with international experts. We discussed with
   them more specific issues such as the Black Lives Matter Movement and
   the engagement of civil society.

   Summary.

   Many white Americans believe that race is no longer central to one's
   opportunities in life, and that we're well on our way to systemic
   racial equality. Are these beliefs accurate? While it's often difficult
   to measure levels of discrimination over time, research into hiring
   discrimination shows that black Americans still face discrimination in
   the hiring process. A meta-analysis of callback rates from all existing
   field experiments (24 total, including data from more than 54,000
   applications across more than 25,000 positions) showed evidence of
   discrimination against both black and Latino applicants. Since 1990
   white applicants received, on average, 36% more callbacks than black
   applicants and 24% more callbacks than Latino applicants with otherwise
   identical r?sum?s. When it comes to Latinos, there is some evidence of
   a decline in discrimination over the past 25 years. Due to the small
   number of field experiments including Latinos, statistical tests
   indicate the evidence of decline is inconclusive. For blacks, however,
   researchers found no change in hiring rates over time.

   Race is often at the forefront of American conversation. It has lately
   emerged with new urgency around discussions of policing, immigration,
   First Amendment rights, and even professional football. And yet even as
   we are confronted with [77]dramatic examples of ongoing racial
   tensions, most white Americans remain convinced that [78]race is no
   longer central to one's opportunities in life. [79]Polling data shows
   that many believe these lingering conflicts represent the actions of a
   few bad apples and aren't in sync with the larger trend toward systemic
   racial equality.

   Are these beliefs accurate? What do we know about long-term trends in
   racialdiscrimination?

   Discrimination, given how it often manifests subtly, is notoriously
   difficult to measure in any context. And until recently we have not had
   much information that we could use to reliably assess changes in
   discrimination over time. However, in [80]our recent study, published
   in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, we were able to
   analyze trends in discrimination by performing a meta-analysis from all
   available field experiments pertaining to one area: racial
   discrimination in hiring. We focused on experiments performed since
   1990, when field studies became more numerous and their
   methodologically improved. We analyzed data from 24 field experiments,
   which included data from more than 54,000 applications across more than
   25,000 positions.

   We chose field experiments as a sample because they are [81]widely
   regarded as the most valid method to assess discrimination. They
   generally come in two major types: R?sum? audits, done through the mail
   or online, submit fictitious r?sum?s with equivalent qualifications and
   ethnically identifiable names. And in-person audits --
   done with trained pairs of testers, white and nonwhite -- have
   participants apply for jobs. By examining the rates of callbacks, or
   invitations to job interviews, for white and nonwhite applicants with
   equivalent qualifications, these studies provide high-quality measures
   of rates of discrimination in hiring.

   Broadly, our meta-analysis of callback rates from all existing field
   experiments showed evidence of discrimination against both black and
   Latino applicants. Since 1990 white applicants received, on average,
   36% more callbacks than black applicants and 24% more callbacks than
   Latino applicants with identical r?sum?s.

   When it comes to Latinos, we found some evidence of a decline in
   discrimination over the past 25 years. Because of the small number of
   field experiments including Latinos, however, statistical tests
   indicate the evidence of decline is inconclusive.

   For black applicants we found no change in hiring rates over time. In
   the figure below, the dots represent results from 21 studies
   contrasting white and black applicants, based on a total of 42,708
   applications for 20,990 positions. The line shows the overall trend.
   The line slants slightly upward, but it's statistically
   indistinguishable from a flat line.

   We wondered if this level of discrimination might be influenced by
   applicant education, applicant gender, study method, occupational
   groups, and local labor market conditions. When we controlled for these
   factors, we found that none account for the trend in discrimination.
   Under these and other adjustments, our results suggest that levels of
   discrimination against black job applicants hasn't changed since 1990.

   Our results do not address the possibility that hiring discrimination
   may have substantially dropped in the 1960s or early 1970s, during the
   civil rights era, when many forms of direct discrimination were
   outlawed. Further, our results pertain only to discrimination at the
   point of hire, not at later points in the employment relationship, such
   as wage setting or promotion decisions. It may be the case, then, that
   meaningful reductions in discrimination have taken place at other
   points in the employment relationship. What our results do point to is
   that at the initial point of entry -- hiring decisions -- blacks remain
   substantially disadvantaged relative to equally qualified whites, and
   we see little indication of progress over time.

   What might account for the stubborn persistence of hiring
   discrimination? At first glance, our findings seem to contradict other
   trends. [82]Attitude surveys [83]indicate that overtly prejudicial
   beliefs have declined, and endorsement of the principles of equal
   treatment regardless of race has increased. Americans appear to have
   become more concerned with diversity and inclusion and, [84]in a small
   number of elite firms, affirmative action practices have made
   meaningful changes in the opportunities available to racial minorities.

   At the same time, however, assessments of subtle forms of racial
   stereotypes and measures of unconscious bias have [85]shown little
   change [86]over time. The vast majority of hiring is subject to very
   little oversight, and compensatory policies that address racial bias
   reach a very small fraction of hiring overall. Together, these trends
   offer little support for optimism about racial progress in the United
   States. While some people may assume that discrimination has declined
   over time, through increasing diversity in institutions along with
   other cultural changes, it seems as though, at least in terms of
   hiring, this expectation doesn't meet with reality.

   We believe that our results provide a strong rationale for affirmative
   action policies and point to the continuing need for the enforcement of
   antidiscrimination legislation. Even among well-intended employers,
   racial bias may lurk in hiring decisions. Whether conscious or not,
   bias continues to affect decision making, and we find little evidence
   that this pattern will diminish on its own. Instead, more active
   intervention may be needed to reduce discrimination at the point of
   hire.

How Discrimination in Health Care Affects Older Americans, and What Health
Systems and Providers Can Do

   Racial and ethnic discrimination has a significant impact on the health
   of people of color, affecting mental health and contributing to high
   blood pressure, negative health behaviors, and early aging.^[44]1 For
   Black older adults, the cumulative effects of race-related stress
   experienced over the course of a life can increase the risk for mental
   and physical health problems.^[45]2

   In health care settings, experiences of discrimination can include
   providers dismissing a patient's symptoms or health concerns, offering
   different treatment based on a patient's type of insurance,^[46]3 or
   not providing care in a patient's preferred language.^[47]4

   We analyzed findings from the Commonwealth Fund 2021 International
   Health Policy Survey of Older Adults to examine experiences of racial
   discrimination in health care settings among Latinx/Hispanic and Black
   older adults. (See "[48]How We Conducted This Study" for more details.)
   To provide some cross-national context, we first detail the extent to
   which older adults in 11 high-income countries believe their national
   health system treats people unfairly because of race or ethnicity. We
   then look more in-depth at the United States and report on older
   Americans' experiences of discrimination and the consequences of health
   providers' unfair or dismissive treatment.^[49]5 Finally, we consider
   steps that U.S. health system leaders, health care educators,
   policymakers, and others can take to address discrimination and
   dismantle systemic racism in health care.

     * Older adults in the United States are more likely to report racial
       and ethnic discrimination in the health system exists, compared
       with their peers in 10 other high-income countries.
     * In the U.S., one in four Black and Latinx/Hispanic adults age 60
       and older reported that they have been treated unfairly or have
       felt that their health concerns were not taken seriously by health
       professionals because of their racial or ethnic background.
     * More than a quarter of U.S. older adults said they did not get the
       care or treatment they felt they needed because of discrimination.
     * U.S. older adults who have experienced discrimination in a health
       care setting were more likely to have worse health status, face
       economic hardships, and be more dissatisfied with their care than
       those who did not experience discrimination.


Findings

   Doty_racial_ethnic_discrimination_older_adults_Exhibit_01

   Looking across 11 high-income countries, one in three older adults in
   the U.S. said they believe their health system treats people
   differently because of their race or ethnicity, nearly double the rate
   of older adults in Canada (17%).

   Doty_racial_ethnic_discrimination_older_adults_Exhibit_02

   In the United States, Black women and men are the most likely of any
   group to believe the health care system very often or often treats
   people differently because of their race or ethnicity. Across racial
   and ethnic groups, more women than men hold this view.

   Doty_racial_ethnic_discrimination_older_adults_Exhibit_03

   When asked whether they have ever been treated unfairly or felt that
   their health concerns were not taken seriously because of their racial
   or ethnic background, one in four Black and Latinx/Hispanic older
   adults in the U.S. said they have experienced this type of
   discrimination, approximately eight times the rate for older white
   adults. There were not significant differences by gender between racial
   or ethnic groups.^[50]6

   Doty_racial_ethnic_discrimination_older_adults_Exhibit_04

   More than a quarter (27%) of all U.S. older adults who experienced
   race- or ethnicity-based discrimination -- either their provider
   treated them unfairly or dismissed their health concerns because of
   their race or ethnicity -- said they did not receive the care they felt
   they needed.^[51]7 Previous research on older adults of color found
   that perceived discrimination was associated with an increased risk of
   avoiding or delaying care, in part because doctors may communicate
   messages that discourage appropriate use of health services.^[52]8

   Doty_racial_ethnic_discrimination_older_adults_Exhibit_05

   The majority (61%) of U.S. older adults who said that they experienced
   discrimination based on their race or ethnicity were Black or Latinx
   (data not shown). Nearly half of those who experienced such
   discrimination reported being in fair or poor health, twice the rate of
   those who did not experience discrimination. In fact, three-quarters of
   adults who have felt discriminated against have three or more chronic
   conditions or need help with daily activities (data not shown). Older
   adults who have faced discrimination based on their race or ethnicity
   are also significantly more likely to feel socially isolated, have a
   mental health diagnosis, and experience a material hardship (always or
   usually feeling stressed about having enough money to pay for food,
   housing, or monthly bills).

   Older adults who have felt discriminated against when receiving care
   are significantly more likely to be dissatisfied with the quality of
   their care than those not reporting discrimination.^[53]9 More than
   four in 10 respondents who reported discrimination said they are
   somewhat or not at all satisfied, about double the rate for those who
   did not report discrimination.

   Consistent with previous research, older Black and Latinx/Hispanic
   adults are more likely than older white adults to report being in fair
   or poor health and to experience material hardships (data not shown).

Policy Recommendations

   Battling discrimination throughout the health care system is imperative
   to advancing health equity. Given that older adults use far more health
   care services than do younger people, and that the U.S. population is
   rapidly aging, addressing discrimination in health care settings is
   especially important for older adults of color. Ending discrimination
   and racism in health care begins with recognizing it and then actively
   working to dismantle it. Following are recommendations for spurring and
   supporting such efforts.

   Promote transparency and accountability by identifying instances of
   discrimination and publicly reporting discrimination data. One way is
   to provide patients with the opportunity to report experiences of
   racism or other types of discrimination when completing standard
   patient satisfaction surveys. Health care organizations could expand
   existing patient experience surveys to ask about discrimination, bring
   these reports to the attention of system leaders, and identify
   opportunities for improvement. To promote accountability, health care
   organizations also could be required to publicly report responses.

   Older adults of color, particularly those with health concerns, have
   many interactions with health personnel. Allowing them opportunities to
   reflect on how they were treated and to report their experiences with
   discrimination are important steps.

   Develop medical school curricula to educate students about how the U.S.
   health care system has harmed patients of color and other historically
   marginalized communities. Studies have shown that medical students'
   perceptions of race and implicit biases, together with false ideas of
   race-based biological differences, can affect their treatment
   recommendations for patients of color.^[54]10 The same is true for
   older patients: when medical students are exposed only to the sickest
   older patients in their training, they may adopt stereotypical thinking
   that affects treatment.^[55]11 To encourage their students to address
   bias, medical schools could teach the history of racism in the health
   system, institute implicit-bias training, and ensure that race is
   understood as a risk marker, not necessarily a risk factor, for health
   outcomes.^[56]12

   Examine how current policies enable discrimination and then remove or
   reform those policies. Understanding how federal, state, and health
   care organizations' policies and care delivery approaches enable
   discrimination and racism is an important step in diagnosing and
   treating racism in the health system at large.^[57]13 The National
   Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine is currently reviewing
   federal policies that promote health disparities, but private
   institutions could also systematically review their policies and
   practices to determine if and how they harm persons of color.^[58]14

   Address the lack of diversity in the U.S. health care workforce. A
   diverse health care workforce can help promote the cultural competency
   of providers and improve access to health care, since providers of
   color are more likely to work in underserved communities, including
   those with large elderly populations.^[59]15 Providers whose racial or
   ethnic background reflects that of their patients can also engender
   greater trust. To foster diversity, medical schools could show how they
   are seeking to improve diversity among faculty and students, evaluate
   the diversity and experiences of those on recruitment committees, and
   target community colleges, historically Black colleges and
   universities, and Hispanic-serving institutions in their
   recruitment.^[60]16

   Provide culturally and contextually appropriate care that addresses
   patients' communication needs and preferences. All patients should have
   the opportunity to receive care the reflects their cultural values and
   language needs. To provide such care, organizations can offer
   translation services and create medical forms in multiple languages and
   provide cultural competency training to staff.^[61]17 Organizations
   also could work with the communities they serve to ensure care delivery
   reflects the needs and preferences of the community.

   By taking these steps, health care organizations can do their part to
   address discrimination against older and younger adults alike to
   improve health equity and outcomes.

   HOW WE CONDUCTED THIS STUDY

   The Commonwealth Fund 2021 International Health Policy Survey of Older
   Adults was conducted from March 1 to June 14, 2021, by SSRS, a U.S.
   survey research firm, and contractors in the other countries. The
   survey was administered to a nationally representative sample of adults
   age 60 and older in the United States from March 11 to May 27, 2021.
   The survey was also administered to adults age 65 and older in
   Australia, Canada, France, Germany, the Netherlands, New Zealand,
   Norway, Sweden, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom.

   The final U.S. sample was 1,969. Interviews were completed either
   online or using computer-assisted telephone interviews. Samples were
   generated using probability-based overlapping landline and mobile phone
   sampling designs. Both mobile and landline telephone numbers were
   included to improve representativeness. For landline samples, standard
   within-household selection procedures were used to increase the
   likelihood of reaching an eligible respondent.

   A common questionnaire was developed, translated, adapted, and adjusted
   for country-specific wording as needed. Interviewers were trained to
   conduct interviews using a standardized protocol. The U.S. response
   rate was 11.2 percent.

   International partners joined with the Commonwealth Fund to sponsor
   surveys, and some countries supported the use of expanded samples to
   enable within-country analyses. Data were weighted to ensure that the
   final outcome was representative of the adult population in each
   country. Weighting procedures considered the sample design, probability
   of selection, and systematic nonresponse across known population
   parameters including region, sex, age, education, and other demographic
   characteristics deemed consistent with standards for each country. In
   the United States, the weighted variables also included race and
   ethnicity.

   The margin of sample error for the 2021 International Health Policy
   Survey of Older Adults was approximately +/- 2 percent for the U.S., at
   the 95 percent confidence interval.

    5. Questions related to experiencing unfair or dismissive treatment
       and the consequences of discrimination were asked in the U.S. only.
       The U.S. sample included adults age 60 and older; respondents who
       self-identified as Asian American or another racial or ethnic group
       were not included in this study because of limited sample sizes.
    6. Black and Latinx/Hispanic adults make up most older adults (61%) in
       the U.S. who reported discrimination, yet these adults comprise
       only 19 percent of the survey population. Sample size of
       respondents who reported discrimination (N=149) is too small to
       stratify the analysis by race and ethnicity.
    7. Sample sizes for this item were too small to stratify by race and
       ethnicity.

   DPIC Releases Major New Report on Race and the U.S. Death Penalty

   The Death Penalty Information Center has released a major new report on
   race and the U.S. death penalty, providing an in-depth look at the
   historical role race has played in the death penalty and detailing the
   pervasive impact racialdiscrimination continues to have throughout
   every stage of a death penalty case today. [141]Enduring Injustice: the
   Persistence of racialdiscrimination in the U.S. Death Penalty.
   released on September 15, 2020, also makes the case for why redressing
   discrimination in the American death penalty is essential if the United
   States is serious about creating a fair and just criminal legal system.

   In early news coverage of the report, the Associated Press wrote: "The
   report from the Death Penalty Information Center is a history lesson in
   how lynchings and executions have been used in America and how
   discrimination bleeds into the entire criminal justice system. It
   traces a line from lynchings of old -- killings outside the law --
   where Black people were killed in an effort to assert social control
   during slavery and Jim Crow, and how that eventually translated into
   state-ordered executions."

   "The death penalty is inextricably linked to our history of slavery, of
   lynching, and Jim Crow segregation, and we wanted to put what is
   happening today in its appropriate context," DPIC Executive Director
   Robert Dunham told Associated Press. "[W]hat the data tells us and what
   history tells us is that they're all part of the same phenomenon."

   The Memphis Commercial Appeal noted that the report was released in an
   environment of social upheaval in which "[o]pponents of the death
   penalty are finding their arguments about the history of
   state-sanctioned executions fit into a wider discourse about racial
   injustice amid nationwide protests against police brutality and
   racism."

   Ngozi Ndulue, DPIC's Senior Director of Research and Special Projects
   and the author of the report, agreed. "We have seen more explicit
   reference to the continued racialdiscrimination in the death penalty
   in the last few months," she told the Commercial Appeal. "This is a
   moment that advocates are really looking for concrete changes and what
   we're trying to do with this report -- the bulk of it was written
   before the deaths of Ahmaud Arbery, Breonna Taylor, George Floyd --
   ties really into the moment of reckoning of racial justice the country
   is having right now."

   The report documents the historic role the U.S. death penalty has
   played as an instrument of social control, tracing its use during
   slavery as a tool for controlling Black populations and curbing
   rebellions through the post-Civil War era in which lynchings and other
   extrajudicial violence rose in prominence and public officials promised
   legal executions as a means to discourage "vigilante justice." As
   lynchings decreased in the early 20th century, the report says,
   executions began to take their place in some of the same circumstances
   that earlier would have ended in lynchings.

   The report cites Virginia as an illustration of the racist deployment
   of capital punishment. "Before the Civil War, Virginia explicitly
   provided different penalties for white people and its enslaved
   population," the report says. "By 1848, white people could be sentenced
   to death only for first-degree murder while enslaved Black people could
   be executed for a number of non-homicide offenses." By the 20^th
   century, the racial categorization of crimes was gone from the law
   books but was retained in practice. From 1900 through 1969, the report
   shows, 258 African Americans were executed, as compared to 46 whites.
   Forty-eight Black men were executed for rape, 20 for attempted rape,
   and 5 for armed robbery. No white person was executed for any crime
   that did not result in death. The same pattern prevailed across the
   South, with hundreds of African-American men condemned and executed for
   the alleged rape or attempted rape of white women or girls. No white
   man was ever executed for raping a Black woman or girl.

   The report also explains that racial bias persists today, as evidenced
   by cases with white victims being more likely to be investigated and
   capitally charged; systemic exclusion of jurors of color from service
   in death-penalty trials; and disproportionate imposition of death
   sentences against defendants of color. "The death penalty has been used
   to enforce racial hierarchies throughout United States history,
   beginning with the colonial period and continuing to this day," Ndulue
   said.

   Among the evidence of continuing discrimination in the use of the death
   penalty, the report references:
     * A 2015 meta-analysis of 30 studies showing that the killers of
       white people were more likely than the killers of Black people to
       face a capital prosecution.
     * A study in North Carolina showing that qualified Black jurors were
       struck from juries at more than twice the rate of qualified white
       jurors. As of 2010, 20 percent of those on the state's death row
       were sentenced to death by all-white juries.
     * Data showing that since executions resumed in 1977, 295
       African-American defendants have been executed for interracial
       murders of white victims, while only 21 white defendants have been
       executed for interracial murders of African Americans.
     * A 2014 mock jury study of more than 500 Californians that found
       white jurors were more likely to sentence poor Latinx defendants to
       death than poor white defendants.
     * Data showing that exonerations of African Americans for murder
       convictions are 22 percent more likely to be linked to police
       misconduct.

   "Racial disparities are present at every stage of a capital case and
   get magnified as a case moves through the legal process," Dunham said.
   "If you don't understand the history, ... you won't understand why.
   With the continuing police and white vigilante killings of Black
   citizens, it is even more important now to focus attention on the
   outsized role the death penalty plays as an agent and validator of
   racialdiscrimination. What is broken or intentionally discriminatory
   in the criminal legal system is visibly worse in death-penalty cases.
   Exposing how the system discriminates in capital cases can shine an
   important light on law enforcement and judicial practices in vital need
   of abolition, restructuring, or reform."

   The death penalty's "discriminatory presence as the apex punishment in
   the American legal system legitimizes all other harsh and
   discriminatory punishments," Ndulue said. "That is why the death
   penalty must be part of any discussion of police reform, prosecutorial
   accountability, reversing mass incarceration, and the criminal legal
   system as a whole."

   came together. "I stand here knowing that my story is part of the
   larger American story ... and that in no other country on Earth is my
   story even possible," he declared. "America, tonight, if you feel the
   same energy that I do, if you feel the same urgency that I do, if you
   feel the same passion that I do, if you feel the same hopefulness that
   I do, if we do what we must do, then I have no doubt that all across
   the country ... the people will rise up in November, and John Kerry
   will be sworn in as president."

   Kerry lost the election, of course, and Bush seemed poised to embody
   the future of the Republican party. But Barack Obama seemed poised to
   embody the future of the Democratic party.

   Two weeks after his exhilarating keynote address, Barack Obama's
   memoir, [89]Dreams from My Father: A Story of Race and Inheritance, was
   republished. It rushed up the charts and got rave reviews in the final
   months of 2004. Toni Morrison, the queen of American letters, deemed
   Dreams from My Father "quite extraordinary". Obama had written the
   memoir in 1995 as he prepared to begin his political career in the
   Illinois senate. In his most anti-racist passage, Obama reflected on
   assimilated biracial blacks like "poor Joyce," his friend at Occidental
   College in Los Angeles. In Joyce and other black students, he "kept
   recognising pieces of myself", Obama wrote. People like Joyce spoke
   about "the richness of their multicultural heritage, and it sounded
   real good, until you noticed that they avoided black people. It wasn't
   a matter of conscious choice, necessarily, just a matter of
   gravitational pull, the way integration always worked, a one-way
   street. The minority assimilated into the dominant culture, not the
   other way around. Only white culture could be `neutral' and
   `objective'. Only white culture could be `nonracial' ... Only white
   culture had `individuals'."

   Obama's anti-racist litany continued in his critical revelation of the
   "extraordinary negro" complex. "We, the half-breeds and the
   college-degreed ... [are] never so outraged as when a cabbie drives
   past us or the woman in the elevator clutches her purse, not so much
   because we're bothered by the fact that such indignities are what less
   fortunate coloureds have to put up with every single day of their lives
   - although that's what we tell ourselves - but because [we] ... have
   somehow been mistaken for an ordinary nigger. Don't you know who I am?
   I'm an individual!"

   Ironically, racist Americans of all colours would in 2004 begin hailing
   Barack Obama, with all his public intelligence, morality, speaking
   ability and political success, as the extraordinary negro. The
   extraordinary-negro hallmark had come a mighty long way from the poet
   Phillis Wheatley to Barack Obama, who became the nation's only African
   American in the US senate in 2005. Since Wheatley, segregationists had
   despised these extraordinary-negro exhibits of black capability and had
   done everything to take them down. But Obama - or rather Obama's era -
   was different. Segregationists turned their backs on their predecessors
   and adored the Obama exhibit as a proclamation of the end of racism.
   They wanted to end the discourse on discrimination.
     __________________________________________________________________

   "He's the first mainstream African American who is articulate and
   bright and clean and a nice-looking guy." Presidential hopeful and
   Delaware senator Joe Biden might as well have labelled Barack Obama the
   extraordinary negro. Biden's evaluations of his presidential rivals
   appeared in the New York Observer days before Obama stood in front of
   the Old State Capitol building in Springfield, Illinois, and formally
   announced his presidential candidacy on 10 February 2007. Obama brimmed
   with words of American unity, hope and change.

   But Joe Biden's comments - which he later "deeply" regretted - became a
   sign of things to come. What was to come over the course of the
   campaign was a reflection of the audacity of racist minds - from George
   W Bush to radio mega-personality Rush Limbaugh to Democratic stalwarts
   - who all viewed Obama as an extraordinary negro. In February 2007,
   Time magazine speculated that African Americans were expressing greater
   support for New York senator [90]Hillary Clinton because of questions
   over whether Obama was "black enough". It couldn't be because they saw
   Obama as a long shot. It had to be that they did not see Obama as
   ordinarily black like them, meaning inarticulate and ugly and unclean
   and unintelligent.

   Pundits were dubbing Hillary Clinton the "inevitable" nominee until
   Barack Obama upset her on 3 January 2008, in the Iowa primary. By Super
   Tuesday on 5 February 2008, Americans had been swept up in the Obama
   "Yes We Can" crusade of hope and change - themes he embodied and spoke
   about so eloquently in his stump speeches that people started to
   hunger. In mid-February, his perceptive and brilliant wife, Michelle
   Obama, told a Milwaukee rally: "For the first time in my adult life, I
   am really proud of my country, and not just because Barack has done
   well, but because I think people are hungry for change."

   Racist commentators searched for dirt on the Obamas. When no dirt could
   be found, investigative reporters started checking their associates. In
   early March 2008, ABC News released snippets of sermons from one of
   black America's most revered liberation theologians, the recently
   retired pastor of Chicago's large Trinity United Church of Christ.
   Jeremiah Wright had married the Obamas and had baptised their two
   daughters. In an ABC News report, Wright was quoted proclaiming, in a
   sermon, that "the government gives them the drugs, builds bigger
   prisons, passes a three-strike law and then wants us to sing `God Bless
   America'. No, no, no ... God damn America for treating our citizens as
   less than human." Wright had discarded the very old racist lesson that
   had first been taught to slaves: that African Americans were supposed
   to love the US and consider it the world's greatest country, no matter
   how they were treated. On top of his rejection of American
   exceptionalism, Wright had the audacity to preach that American
   "terrorism" abroad had helped bring on the tragic events of 9/11. To
   put it lightly, Americans everywhere were livid.

   When Obama's flippant characterisations of Wright as a fraught "old
   uncle" did not calm Americans down, Obama decided to address the
   controversy. On 18 March 2008, he stepped into the spotlight and gave a
   "race speech," entitled A More Perfect Union, at Philadelphia's
   National Constitutional Center. Having taught constitutional law,
   worked in civil rights law, and overseen successful political campaigns
   (including his current campaign, which analysts were already regarding
   as masterful), Obama could easily be regarded as an expert on many
   things: constitutional law, civil rights law, Chicago politics,
   Illinois politics, campaigning, and race and politics.

   Obama dismissed Jeremiah Wright's "profoundly distorted view", but
   courageously refused to totally disown Wright. And then he opened his
   general lecture on race, explaining that socioeconomic racial
   inequities stemmed from the history of discrimination. From this firm
   anti-racist opening, he pivoted to the consensus racist theory of the
   "pervasive achievement gap", to the disproven racist theory of "the
   erosion of black families" that "welfare policies ... may have
   worsened", and to the unproven racist theory that racialdiscrimination
   had bequeathed blacks a "legacy of defeat". According to Obama, this
   "legacy of defeat" explained why "young men and, increasingly, young
   women" were "standing on street corners or languishing in our prisons".
   He ignored the fact that this population was facing some of the
   nation's highest unemployment and policing rates.

   Those anti-racists like Jeremiah Wright, their "anger is not always
   productive", Obama continued. "Indeed, all too often it distracts
   attention from solving real problems; it keeps us from squarely facing
   our own complicity within the African American community in our
   condition."

   It was a classic assimilationist retort: calling anti-racists "angry"
   for truly believing in racial equality, for not seeing anything wrong
   with black people, and for seeing everything wrong with discrimination.
   Like civil rights activists [91]WEB Du Bois and [92]Martin Luther King
   before him, Obama lumped these "angry" anti-racists in with angry,
   anti-white cynics to discredit them and distinguish himself from them.
   But Du Bois and King ultimately had to ward off the same "angry" and
   anti-white labels they had helped to produce. And now, Obama was doing
   the same thing, unaware that he was reproducing a label that his
   opponents would stamp on to him whenever and wherever he uttered
   another anti-racist word after this speech.

   Barack Obama's 2008 speech at the National Constitution Center in
   Philadelphia

   Obama encouraged African Americans to fight discrimination, take
   personal responsibility, be better parents and end the "legacy of
   defeat". Obama did not offer any childrearing or psychological lessons
   for the presumably parentally and psychologically superior white
   Americans. He merely asked them to join him on the "long march" against
   racialdiscrimination - "not just with words but with deeds". He left
   the Philadelphia platform on 18 March 2008, as he began, expressing the
   half-truthful analogy of continuous racial progression. "This union may
   never be perfect," he said, "but generation after generation has shown
   that it can always be perfected."

   Segregationist and anti-racist critiques were drowned out by the
   eruption of praise across the ideological aisle. MSNBC political
   analyst Michelle Bernard framed it as "the best speech and most
   important speech on race that we have heard as a nation since Martin
   Luther King's `I Have a Dream' speech". And it was not just Democrats
   who were fawning. Prominent Republicans - everyone from presidential
   candidates Mike Huckabee and John McCain to the Bush administration's
   Condoleezza Rice and Colin Powell, and the Clintons' old foe, Newt
   Gingrich - were also praising the speech.

   Meanwhile, Republican producers of racist ideas got down to business,
   demanding to see [94]Obama's birth certificate, questioning whether
   Barack Hussein Obama was really an American, and suggesting that only
   real Americans, who were white like McCain, could live in the White
   House of the United States. The Obama campaign released [95]a scanned
   copy of his US birth certificate, but the rumours of Obama being born
   in Kenya or some Islamic anti-American nation did not suddenly go away.
   They were not started out of ignorance, so why would they go away out
   of knowledge?
     __________________________________________________________________

   On 4 November 2008, a 64-year-old recently retired professor cast a
   vote for a major political party for the first time in her voting life.
   She had retired from academia, but not from her very public activism of
   four decades. She was still travelling the country trying to rouse an
   abolitionist movement against prisons. In casting her vote for Democrat
   Barack Obama, [96]Angela Davis joined roughly 69.5 million Americans.
   But more than voting for the man, Davis voted for the grassroots
   efforts of the campaign organisers, those millions of people demanding
   change.

   When the networks started announcing that Obama had been elected the
   44th president of the United States, happiness exploded from coast to
   coast, and from the US around the anti-racist world. Davis was in the
   delirium of Oakland, California. People she did not know came up and
   hugged her as she walked along the streets. She saw people singing and
   dancing. And the people [97]Angela Davis saw and all the others around
   the world who were celebrating were not enraptured from the election of
   an individual; they were enraptured by the pride of the victory for
   black people, by the success of millions of grassroots organisers, and
   because they had shown all those disbelievers, who had said that
   electing a black president was impossible, to be wrong. Most of all,
   they were enraptured by the anti-racist potential of a black president.

   Behind the scenes of exploding happiness that November night and over
   the next few weeks, was the exploding fury of hate attacks on black
   people. The establishment was working overtime to take down some of the
   colour-blind rhetoric that had prevented consumers from seeing
   discrimination for a decade. It was working to put up something better:
   a portrait of America conveying that there was no longer any need for
   protective or affirmative civil rights laws and policies - and no
   longer any need to ever talk about race. "Are we now in a post-racial
   America? ... Is America past racism against black people?" John
   McWhorter, professor at Columbia, asked in Forbes weeks after the
   election. "I say the answer is yes."
     __________________________________________________________________

   When will the day arrive when black lives matter to Americans? It
   depends largely on what anti-racists do - and on the strategies they
   use to stamp out racist ideas. Racial reformers have customarily
   requested or demanded that Americans, particularly white Americans,
   sacrifice their own privileges for the betterment of black people. And
   yet, this strategy is based on one of the oldest myths of the modern
   era, a myth continuously produced and reproduced by racists and
   anti-racists alike: that racism materially benefits the majority of
   white people, that white people would lose and not gain in the
   reconstruction of an anti-racist America.

   It has been true that racist policies have benefited white people in
   general at the expense of black people (and others) in general. That is
   the story of racism, of unequal opportunity in a nutshell. But it is
   also true that a society of equal opportunity, without a top 1%
   hoarding the wealth and power, would actually benefit the vast majority
   of white people much more than racism does.

   Anti-racists should stop connecting selfishness to racism, and
   unselfishness to anti-racism. Altruism is wanted, not required.
   Anti-racists do not have to be altruistic. Anti-racists do not have to
   be selfless. Anti-racists merely have to have intelligent
   self-interest, and to stop consuming those racist ideas that have
   engendered so much unintelligent self-interest over the years. It is in
   the intelligent self-interest of middle- and upper-income blacks to
   challenge the racism affecting the black poor, knowing they will not be
   free of the racism that is slowing their socio-economic rise until poor
   blacks are free of racism.

   It is in the intelligent self-interest of white Americans to challenge
   racism, knowing they will not be free of sexism, class bias, homophobia
   and ethnocentrism until black people are free of racism. The histories
   of anti-Asian, anti-Native and anti-Latina/o racist ideas; the
   histories of sexist, elitist, homophobic, and ethnocentric ideas: all
   sound eerily similar to this history of racist ideas, and feature some
   of the same defenders of bigotry in America. Supporting these
   prevailing bigotries is only in the intelligent self-interest of a tiny
   group of super-rich, Protestant, heterosexual, non-immigrant, white,
   Anglo-Saxon males. Those are the only people who need to be altruistic
   in order to be anti-racist. The rest of us merely need to do the
   intelligent thing for ourselves.

   Historically, black people have by and large worked out that the
   smartest thing we could do for ourselves is to promote the notion of
   uplift. Beginning around the 1790s, abolitionists urged the growing
   number of free blacks to exhibit upstanding behaviour in front of white
   people, believing they would thereby undermine the racist beliefs
   behind slavery. Black people would acquire "the esteem, confidence and
   patronage of the whites, in proportion to your increase in knowledge
   and moral improvement," as the abolitionist William Lloyd Garrison
   lectured free blacks in the 1830s.

   History shows not only that uplift has failed, but that, generally
   speaking, the opposite of its intended effect has occurred. Racist
   Americans have routinely despised those black Americans the most who
   uplifted themselves, who defied those racist laws and theories that
   individuals employed to keep them down. So upwardly mobile black people
   have not persuaded away racist ideas or policies. Quite the contrary.
   Uplift has brought on the progression of new racist policies and ideas
   after blacks broke through the old ones.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Everyone who has witnessed the historic presidency of Barack Obama -
   and the historic opposition to him - should now know full well that the
   more black people uplift themselves, the more they will find themselves
   on the receiving end of a racist backlash. Uplift, as a strategy for
   racial progress, has failed. Black individuals must stop worrying about
   what other people may think about them. Individual blacks are not race
   representatives. They are not responsible for those Americans who hold
   racist ideas. Black people need to be their imperfect selves around
   white people, around each other, around all people. Black is beautiful
   and ugly, intelligent and unintelligent, law-abiding and law-breaking,
   industrious and lazy - and it is those imperfections that make black
   people human, make black people equal to all other imperfectly human
   groups.

   The other major strategy that racial reformers have used is educational
   persuasion. As a strategy for racial progress, educational persuasion
   has failed, because it has been predicated on the false construction of
   the race problem: the idea that ignorance and hate lead to racist
   ideas, which lead to racist policies. In fact, self-interest leads to
   racist policies, which lead to racist ideas, leading to all the
   ignorance and hate.

   Racist policies were created out of self-interest. And so, they have
   usually been voluntarily rolled back out of self-interest. The popular
   and glorious version of history saying that abolitionists and civil
   rights activists have steadily educated and persuaded away American
   racist ideas and policies sounds great. But it has never been the
   complete story, or even the main story. Politicians passed the civil
   and voting rights measures in the 1860s and the 1960s primarily out of
   political and economic self-interest - not an educational or moral
   awakening. And these laws did not spell the doom of racist policies.
   The racist policies simply evolved. There has been a not-so-glorious
   progression of racism, and educational persuasion has failed to stop
   it, and Americans have failed to recognise it.

   History is clear. Sacrifice, uplift, persuasion and education have not
   eradicated, are not eradicating, and will not eradicate racist ideas,
   let alone racist policies. Power will never sacrifice self-interest,
   cannot be educated away from its self-interest. Those who have the
   power to abolish racialdiscrimination have not done so thus far, and
   they will never do so as long as racism benefits them in some way.

   I am certainly not stating that there are no Americans in positions of
   power who have ever tried to end racial disparities in their sphere of
   influence. But these courageous anti-racist powerbrokers are more the
   exception than the rule. As Americans have discarded old racist ideas,
   new racist ideas have constantly been produced for their consumption.
   That's why the effort to educate and persuade away racist ideas has
   been a never-ending affair in America. That's why education will never
   bring into being an anti-racist America.

   To undermine racialdiscrimination, Americans must focus their efforts
   on those who have the power to undermine racialdiscrimination. History
   has shown that those Americans who have had the power to undermine
   racialdiscrimination have rarely done so. They have done so, however,
   when they realised that eliminating some form of racialdiscrimination
   was in their interest, much as Abraham Lincoln chose to end slavery to
   save the union. They have also conceded to anti-racist change as a
   better alternative than the disruptive, disordered, politically harmful
   and/or unprofitable conditions that anti-racist protesters created.

   The most effective protests have been fiercely local; they are protests
   started by anti-racists focusing on their immediate surroundings: their
   blocks, neighbourhoods, schools, colleges, jobs and professions. These
   local protests have then become statewide protests, and statewide
   protests have then become national protests, and national protests have
   then become international protests. But it all starts with one person,
   or two people, or tiny groups, in their small surroundings, engaging in
   energetic mobilisation of anti-racists into organisations; and
   chess-like planning and adjustments during strikes, occupations,
   insurrections, campaigns and fiscal and bodily boycotts, among a series
   of other tactics to force power to eradicate racist policies.
   Anti-racist protesters have created positions of power for themselves
   by articulating clear demands and making it even clearer that they will
   not stop - and that policing forces cannot stop them - until their
   demands are met.

   But protesting against racist policies can never be a long-term
   solution to eradicating racialdiscrimination in America. Just as one
   generation of powerful Americans could decide or be pressured by
   protest to end racialdiscrimination, when the conditions and interests
   change, another generation could once again encourage racial
   discrimination. That's why protesting against racist power has been a
   never-ending affair in America.

   Protesting against racist power and succeeding can never be mistaken
   for seizing power. Any effective solution to eradicating American
   racism must involve Americans committed to anti-racist policies seizing
   and maintaining power over institutions, neighbourhoods, counties,
   states, nations - the world. It makes no sense to sit back and put the
   future in the hands of people committed to racist policies, or people
   who sail with the wind of self-interest. An anti-racist America can
   only be guaranteed if principled anti-racists are in power, and then
   anti-racist policies become the law of the land, and then anti-racist
   ideas become the common sense of the people, and then the anti-racist
   common sense of the people holds those anti-racist leaders and policies
   accountable.

   And that day is sure to come. No power lasts for ever. There will come
   a time when Americans will realise that the only thing wrong with black
   people is that they think something is wrong with black people. There
   will come a time when racist ideas will no longer obstruct us from
   seeing the complete and utter abnormality of racial disparities.

   There will come a time when we will love humanity, when we will gain
   the courage to fight for an equitable society for our beloved humanity,
   knowing, intelligently, that when we fight for humanity, we are
   fighting for ourselves. There will come a time. Maybe, just maybe, that
   time is now.

Education is key to deconstruct racial narratives

   [racialdiscrimination_web688x358_en.jpg?itok=-kMcBm6f]
   ? UNESCO / Olivier Marie
   23 March 2018
   Last update: 21 April 2022

   The role of education at all social levels and in particular of young
   generations, remains one of the best ways to stop the proliferation of
   racist and discriminatory discourses and to foster intercultural
   exchanges. This is the message of experts who gathered on 21 March at
   UNESCO in Paris for a Round table on Deconstructing racial narratives:
   challenging assumptions and fostering diversity, organized in the
   context of the International Day for the Elimination of Racial
   Discrimination.

   The event started with a presentation by Evelyne Heyer, Professor of
   the National Museum of Natural History of France, who explained the
   scientific evidence against the notion of race, which has resulted in
   practices ranging from discrimination to extermination of "the other"
   throughout history.

   "Races do not exist in the sense we thought in the 19th century, but
   even if the word `race' is removed, racism will continue to exist. The
   term `race' has a history, so we need to use this concept, if only to
   deconstruct it," said Heyer.

   According to the professor, the DNA of all human beings is 99.9%
   identical, and we all are of African origin, dating back 100,000 years.
   With only 0.1% of differences in the genomes of people from across the
   world, the notion of race is not justifiable, she says.

   "Racism is not just about skin color, but about discrimination against
   individuals who are physically, culturally or morally different," Heyer
   explained, adding that our genetic diversity is the result of
   adaptations to environments and our geographical origins.
   Three key components are at the basis of the definition of racism:
   categorization, hierarchization and essentialization. Categorization is
   a mental operation that simplifies the world. People classify
   individuals based on their appearance, their religion, their
   geographical origin, etc. Hierarchization involves a value judgment
   based on regarding one group or category of individuals as being
   superior or inferior to another. Essentialization is a process by which
   individuals are reduced to moral characteristics, intellectual
   faculties or psychological traits alleged to be an immutable and
   inherited feature of that particular group.

   Victoria Tauli-Corpuz, UN Special Rapporteur on the Rights of
   Indigenous Peoples, described racism from the perspective of indigenous
   communities and movements.

   "Indigenous peoples have experienced racism and discrimination since
   colonization. Racism was used deliberately to make them feel inferior
   and to take the resources from their lands. The strategy was to make
   them forget who they are," she said. "The good news is that indigenous
   peoples are waking up, asserting their identities, and using the legal
   framework to protect their lands and fight against discrimination."

   For Rita Izs?k-Ndiaye, expert member of the Committee on the
   Elimination of racialdiscrimination, the fight against racial
   discrimination starts at home, in our own families: "I am a white Roman
   Christian and my husband is a Black Muslim. When I look at my family, I
   see that, because of love and being bound by the same values, we can
   deal with intercultural and interreligious tensions."

   Noting the spread of hateful messages and the reinforcement of
   stereotypes through social media, Izs?k-Ndiaye says it is necessary to
   stimulate constructive debates. "We cannot remain quiet in the face of
   hatred. We need a critical mass of anti-racist people active on social
   media fighting against the wrong discourses," she commented. "Everyone
   owns society. Education, arts, music, literature and science need to
   include everyone."

   At the end of the panel, the discussants agreed that the only way to
   fight racism is through education and action. "At the early stages of
   education, children need to be taught that they should look at others
   as equal to them. Promoting intercultural exchanges is crucial for the
   education system to build more harmonious societies," said
   Tauli-Corpuz.

   The event was followed by the inauguration of the abridged version of
   the travelling exhibition "Us and Them - From Prejudice to Racism" with
   welcoming remarks from Andr? Delpuech, Director of the Mus?e de
   l'Homme. It offers a journey that deciphers the reasons for racist and
   discriminatory behavior during certain moments of history and sheds
   light on racist behavior and prejudices. Conceived by the National
   Museum of Natural History of France, and shown at the Mus?e de l'Homme
   from March 2017 to January 2018 under the patronage of UNESCO, the
   exhibition will travel to different member cities of UNESCO's
   International Coalition of Inclusive and Sustainable Cities - ICCAR.

Racial and Class Discrimination in the History of the American South

   Topic: History Words: 1387 Pages: 5 Dec 16th, 2022

Introduction

   The American South became famous in world historiography due to extreme
   forms of slavery and discrimination from the white planter class. The
   peculiar way of life and plantation culture of the American South
   developed during the British colonization of North America and evolved
   after the country gained independence. The South of the USA includes,
   for the most part, the states that in 1861-1865 made up the Confederate
   States of America and opposed the North during the American Civil War.

   The climate of the South made it possible to grow plantation crops.
   Before 1800, slave labor benefited tobacco, rice, sugarcane, indigo,
   and hemp growers^1. Agriculture demanded year-round work, which, with a
   shortage of labor from the 17th century, led to the use of the labor of
   Negro slaves. In this regard, in the southern English colonies in North
   America, plantation slavery, features of an aristocratic culture
   appeared, close to the landowning nobility in Europe. The North-South
   Civil War and the Civil Rights Movement are two events in the history
   of the American South caused by racial and class discrimination.

The Civil War

The Roles of Race and Class

   The key differences between the industrialized North and the agrarian
   South of the United States were further intensified in the early 19th
   century. The Industrial Revolution began in the North, and in the
   South, the invention of the cotton gin made cotton the main crop. The
   North quickly overtook the South in terms of population: by 1860,
   Southerners made up only a third of the US population. Focusing on the
   foreign market, the South, to maintain its slave system, took the
   extreme step of separating from the United States: in 1861, the
   Confederate States of America was proclaimed. This event sparked a
   civil war in which the South was defeated. After that, the so-called
   Reconstruction of the South was carried out, which lasted until 1877. A
   military administration was introduced in the southern states; most of
   the southern states were occupied for a long time, having almost no
   political rights.

   The American Civil War, also called the War of the North and the South,
   went down in history as the largest conflict on the American continent.
   The consensus of modern historians is that slavery was the chief cause
   of the Civil War^2. Free emigrants replenished the population of the
   northern states and the southern states by slaves imported from abroad.
   By the early 1860s, only a quarter of the population of the southern
   states had the right to vote. Southerners feared that with such
   dynamics, all controversial political issues in Congress would be
   decided in favor of the North because they had the majority of voice.

   All agriculture in the South was based on free slave labor, and
   unskilled factory slaves were inefficient. The industrialists of the
   North needed slavery to get free workers, so they advocated the
   abolition of slavery. In addition, for southern planters, this would
   mean the collapse of the entire economic system built. Besides, the
   moral side of the issue was also important: many public figures in
   America criticized slavery as an inhuman relic of the past and demanded
   its abolition.

Other Reasons

   In addition, the central government, located in the North, sought to
   extend influence to all states, while the Southern Territories wanted
   to maintain local self-government. The country's entire industry was
   concentrated in the North, while cotton, sugarcane, tobacco, and other
   industrial crops were collected in the South. The Southern states
   supplied raw materials to the North for a long time, where local
   producers processed it and exported goods. However, at some point, the
   planters realized that it was much more profitable to trade with Europe
   without intermediaries. The manufacturers of the North were at risk of
   running out of supplies, and European ones were supplanting their goods
   in the South. Wanting to protect the domestic market, the government
   imposed huge taxes on trade with Europe, which caused discontent among
   the southerners.

The Civil Rights Movement

The Roles of Race and Class

   The Civil Rights Movement became a grassroots movement of black
   American citizens and white activists who supported them against racial
   discrimination in the 1950s and 1960s. In the southern states,
   centuries of slavery and decades of segregation have created a legal
   and political system characterized by white supremacy. There were laws
   according to which Afro-Americans could not study at schools and
   universities along with whites and had their system of schools and
   universities; they had to occupy specially designated places for them
   in public transport. Many shops, restaurants, hotels refused to serve
   blacks. The whites counted on their obedience; the resistance of the
   Afro-Americans seemed unthinkable. Many white southerners were
   convinced that Afro-Americans had taken on the role of second-class
   citizens, and they even liked it.

   The African American legal strategy culminated in the US Supreme Court
   in 1954, under the leadership of Earl Warren, which overturned many
   laws that allowed for racial segregation and discrimination. The
   movement began when the US Supreme Court concedes that segregation is
   wrong. ^3African Americans were re-entering politics in the South, and
   young people across the country were inspired to take action. From 1964
   to 1970, a wave of urban riots and protests in black communities
   weakened support from the white middle class, but support from private
   foundations increased. The emergence of the Black Power movement
   challenged the established black leadership for its cooperation and
   continued legalism and non-violence. Many popular ideas about the
   movement are linked to the racially discriminatory movement of Martin
   Luther King Jr., who was fighting racial inequality through nonviolent
   resistance.

Other Reasons

   Two main causes drove the civil rights movement; discrimination and
   segregation of African Americans. Another reason for the rise of the
   movement can be called the economic superiority of the white population
   over the blacks. The starting point was the stereotypes entrenched in
   society that made strong racialdiscrimination possible. People's
   discontent grew, given that a significant part of the population did
   not even have the right to vote, children could not study on an equal
   basis with others, discrimination even touched places on buses.

One Race or Class Has Been More Powerful than the Other

   Historically, the white race has always had economic and social
   superiority over the black race. However, racial and class superiority
   did not stop African Americans from fighting for their rights and
   making a difference. On the side of the oppressed population was the
   moral right to be considered equal to the other part of the population.
   This realization of the rightness of one's actions led, for example, to
   the success of the Civil Rights Movement. Although the Civil War ended
   in defeat for the South, it set in motion a chain of societal changes
   that led African Americans to improve their position later on.

The Most Powerful in Driving the History of the American South

   The history of the American South was largely influenced by slavery.
   Oppression, cruelty, and discrimination led to a fierce struggle for
   the black population for their rights^4. Slavery radically influenced
   American South history and the development of the entire country. Four
   hundred years ago, the British brought the first African slaves to
   Virginia. This event marked the beginning of the British and American
   transatlantic slave trade. From 1619 to 1860, about 600 thousand
   African slaves were forcibly imported into the United States. By the
   middle of the 19th century, the number of black slaves in the United
   States had reached about 4 million people. Their exploitation played an
   important role in the development of American capitalism. Slavery in
   the United States was prohibited only in 1865, but for another 100
   years, segregation restrictions were in effect in the country:
   segregation restrictions were lifted only in the 1960s. The
   socio-economic consequences of the slave system in America are still
   being felt.

Conclusion

   Racial and class discrimination can be called the main driving force in
   the history of the American South. Discrimination was the main cause of
   the events described: the American Civil War and the Civil Rights
   Movement. There were other reasons, mostly behind the key differences
   between the industrial North and the agrarian South. Slavery can, in
   principle, be called the cause that influenced the course of the
   development of the United States as a whole. Even in modern society,
   echoes of this terrible oppression are heard.

   Protesters at a rally in Minneapolis call for justice for George Floyd

racialdiscrimination in the United States

   Human Rights Watch / ACLU Joint Submission Regarding the United States'
   Record Under the International Convention on the Elimination of All
   Forms of racialdiscrimination

Introduction

   The United States signed the International Convention on the
   Elimination of All Forms of racialdiscrimination ("ICERD" or
   "Convention") in 1966. President Lyndon Johnson's administration noted
   at the time that the United States "has not always measured up to its
   constitutional heritage of equality for all" but that it was "on the
   march" toward compliance.[15][1] The United States finally ratified the
   Convention in 1994 and first reported on its progress in implementing
   the Convention to the Committee on the Elimination of Racial
   Discrimination ("CERD" or "Committee") in 2000. In August 2022, the
   Committee will examine the combined 10^th - 12^th periodic reports by
   the United States on compliance with the Convention. This report
   supplements the submission of the government with additional
   information in key areas and offers recommendations that will, if
   adopted, enhance the government's ability to comply with ICERD.

   In its 2000 report, the United States stated that "overt
   discrimination" is "less pervasive than it was thirty years ago" but
   admitted it continued due to "subtle forms of discrimination" that
   "persist[ed] in American society."[16][2] The forms of discrimination
   reported to the United Nations by the United States included
   "inadequate enforcement of existing anti-discrimination laws";
   "ineffective use and dissemination of data"; economic disadvantage
   experienced by minority groups; "persistent discrimination in
   employment and labour relations"; "segregation and discrimination in
   housing" leading to diminished educational opportunities for
   minorities; lack of equal access to capital, credit markets and
   technology; discrimination in the criminal legal system; lack of
   adequate access to health insurance and health care; and discrimination
   against immigrants, among other harmful effects.[17][3] The United
   States also noted the heightened impact of racism on women and
   children.

   It has now been more than 50 years since the US signed the ICERD,
   nearly 30 years since it ratified the Convention, and more than 20
   since it identified the extensive foregoing list of impediments to its
   effective implementation. Yet progress toward compliance remains
   elusive--indeed, grossly inadequate--in numerous key areas including
   reparative justice; discrimination in the US criminal legal system; use
   of force by law enforcement officials; discrimination in the regulation
   and enforcement of migration control; and stark disparities in the
   areas of economic opportunity and health care. Structural racism and
   xenophobia persist as powerful and pervasive forces in American
   society.

   During his first days in office, President Joseph Biden called for
   urgent action to advance equity for all, calling this a "battle for the
   soul of [the] nation" because "systemic racism" is "corrosive,"
   "destructive" and "costly."[18][4] As this report and its annex,
   jointly authored by the American Civil Liberties Union and Human Rights
   Watch, demonstrate, the US has a great deal of work ahead to realize
   the promises of the ICERD.[19][5] This report therefore includes
   important recommendations in areas in which our organizations have
   specialized expertise, for addressing some of the US's most flagrant
   violations of the Convention. Additionally, although we recognize the
   political challenges facing the Biden Administration as it seeks to
   promote racial equity, we note that its recent declarations on racial
   justice are disconnected from the government's longstanding human
   rights obligations under the ICERD. The attached annex therefore
   identifies additional, more targeted measures to align President
   Biden's commitments with the ICERD. These measures are both fully
   within the control of the executive branch of the federal government
   and powerful enough to give life to the President's stated commitment
   to put "every branch of the White House and the federal government" to
   work in the effort to "eliminate systemic racism" in the United
   States.[20][6]

   President Biden has declared that racism, xenophobia, nativism, and
   other forms of intolerance are "global problems."[21][7] The ICERD is
   an important part of the solution and to confront these global problems
   effectively, the US should fulfill its obligations under the
   treaty.[22][8] This report and its detailed annex offer an initial
   roadmap for the US to do exactly that.


Reparative Justice for the Legacy of Enslavement

   Article 6 of the ICERD establishes the right to remedy and to seek just
   and adequate reparation for acts of racialdiscrimination such as
   enslavement, the many post-emancipation crimes against Black people in
   the United States, and the insufficiently remediated ongoing
   discriminatory structures. The US government has never adequately
   addressed the gross human rights violations perpetrated against Black
   people as part of chattel slavery or the exploitation, segregation, and
   violence unleashed on Black people that followed. The discrimination
   against Black people that is a legacy of enslavement persists and is
   perpetuated by economic, health, education, law enforcement, and
   housing, and other policies and practices that fail to adequately
   address racial disparities--part of the ongoing structural racism and
   racial subjugation that prevents many Black people from advancing, and
   facilitates police violence, housing segregation, and a lack of access
   to education and employment opportunities, among other things. States
   are obligated under the ICERD to overcome such structural
   discrimination, both through effective remedies--such as reparations
   and "special measures"--and through the Convention's obligation to
   "[t]ake steps to remove all obstacles that prevent the enjoyment of
   economic, social and cultural rights by people of African descent
   especially in the areas of education, housing, employment and
   health."[23][9]

   The ICERD requires States Parties to "assure to everyone within their
   jurisdiction effective protection and remedies, through the competent
   national tribunals and other State institutions, against any acts of
   racialdiscrimination" and to ensure "the right to seek from such
   tribunals just and adequate reparation or satisfaction for any damage
   suffered as a result of such discrimination."[24][10] The CERD has
   noted that the right to seek just and adequate reparation "is not
   necessarily secured by the punishment of the perpetrator of the
   discrimination" and that "the courts and other competent authorities
   should consider awarding financial compensation for damage, material or
   moral, suffered by a victim, whenever appropriate."[25][11] The UN has
   also established principles on the right of victims to remedies and
   reparations, and specifically set forth the right to reparations for
   people of African descent.[26][12] Although States generally only incur
   international responsibility for acts that are both internationally
   wrongful and attributable to the State, [27]this principle does not
   apply to slavery and its legacy.[28][13] While the US has enacted civil
   rights statutes since the 1950s, such legislation has been largely
   ineffective at curbing structural discrimination and racial inequality
   because of judicial decisions that significantly undermined their scope
   and meager government enforcement and investment, as well as the
   onerous requirements of discriminatory intent instead of discriminatory
   effect. Further, the US has [29]consistently indicated in its ICERD
   reporting that "inadequate funding" is one of the central reasons for
   insufficient federal enforcement.[30][14] The failure of the US to
   expand enforcement efforts and resources while acknowledging these
   widespread disparities over the last twenty-two years since it became a
   party to ICERD requires immediate redress.

   Reparative intervention for historical and contemporary racial
   injustice is urgent and required by ICERD.[31][15] The deep racial
   harms and unequal structures that are inextricably rooted in chattel
   slavery remain unremedied, perpetuating systemic inequality.
   [32]Scholars have estimated that the US benefited from 222,505,049
   hours of forced labor between 1619 and the end of slavery in 1865,
   which would be valued at $97 trillion today.[33][16] In 1860 alone,
   there were four million enslaved Africans whose labor is valued [34]at
   least $3 billion,[35][17] which was more than all the capital invested
   in railroads and factories in the United States [36]combined.[37][18]
   Enslaved people were subjected to brutal  [38]forced labor as well as
   formal and informal state-sanctioned discrimination that resulted in
   severe economic damage, in addition to psychological, social and
   political harm.[39][19]

   Black people in the US continue to endure severe economic disadvantages
   in wealth[40][20] and income[41][21] and suffer from discriminatory
   policies in land and home ownership,[42][22] denial of health
   care,[43][23] and segregation in education.[44][24] The resulting
   disparities are staggering: The average white family has roughly ten
   times the wealth of the average Black family and white college
   graduates have over seven times more wealth than Black college
   graduates.[45][25] With the current pace of growth in wealth among
   Black families, it will take an estimated 230 years for Black families
   to obtain the same amount of wealth that white families currently
   have.[46][26] About 21 percent of Black people in the United States
   live in poverty, more than double the rate for white people (8.8
   percent).[47][27] Although "these wealth disparities are rooted in
   historic injustices and carried forward by recent and ongoing practices
   and policies that fail to reverse inequitable trends,"[48][28] to date
   the US government has not done nearly enough to address the lasting and
   contemporary racially discriminatory effects of structures of
   inequality and racial subordination. It has also openly admitted to
   failing to provide sufficient resources for civil rights enforcement
   even though ICERD requires restitution, compensation, and
   restoration.[49][29]

   While the CERD has not yet made specific recommendations to the US with
   regard to reparative justice, the UN High Commissioner for Human
   Rights, in her 2021 report on systemic racism in law enforcement, urged
   the US (alongside other governments) to initiate reparations.[50][30]
   Although some localities have implemented reparation initiatives or
   commissions to address past racially motivated harms,[51][31]^there
   remains no formal nationwide federal initiative to advance reparations.
   Neither US courts nor other tribunals have provided reliable remedies
   for the descendants of enslaved people.[52][32] H.R. 40 - Commission to
   Study and Develop Reparation Proposals for African Americans Act, a
   bill currently before the House of Representatives, would establish a
   commission to study the effects of slavery and recommend appropriate
   remedies.[53][33] But [54]no progress has been reported as of this
   writing.[55][34] In sum, the US federal government continues to neglect
   its ICERD commitments to remedy the systemic, longstanding and grave
   legacy of enslavement and racialdiscrimination.

To address ongoing structural racism and legacies of enslavement, the US
should:

     * Establish a federal commission by legislative action or executive
       order to study and develop reparations proposals for the
       descendants of enslaved people.
     * Appropriate effective resources for federal economic and civil
       rights programs to address long-term structural racism and provide
       assistance to low-wealth and low-income Black communities.



racialdiscrimination in the Criminal Legal System

Mass Incarceration

   Article 2(1) of ICERD states that States Parties need to pursue the
   elimination of racialdiscrimination in all its forms. ICERD prohibits
   discriminatory practices and requires that States Parties "take
   effective measures to review governmental, national and local policies,
   and to amend, rescind or nullify any laws which have the effect of
   creating or perpetuating discrimination."[56][35] Additionally, Article
   5 guarantees equality before the law, including "the right to equal
   treatment before tribunals and all other organs administering
   justice";[57][36] and article 6 requires states to guarantee "effective
   protection and remedies, through competent national tribunals," against
   acts of racialdiscrimination.[58][37]

   The CERD has broadly articulated that "the mere fact of belonging to a
   racial or ethnic group . . . is not a sufficient reason, de jure or de
   facto, to place a person in pretrial detention"[59][38] and that States
   should "ensure that the courts do not apply harsher punishments solely
   because of an accused person's membership of a specific racial or
   ethnic group."[60][39] Additionally, the UN, in its 2021 common
   position on incarceration, stated that "incarceration should be used as
   a last resort," and recommended shifting to non-custodial
   alternatives.[61][40]

   The CERD has repeatedly emphasized profound concerns with the US
   criminal legal system, [62]first articulated in its 2001 Concluding
   Observations to the US, in which it noted that "the incarceration rate
   is particularly high with regard to African-Americans and
   Hispanics."[63][41] It thus recommended that the US take "firm action
   to guarantee the right of everyone, without distinction as to race,
   colour, or national or ethnic origin," to equal treatment before all
   organs administering justice.[64][42] In its most recent review, the
   Committee went further, expressing its concern that "members of racial
   and ethnic minorities, particularly African Americans, continue to be
   disproportionately arrested, incarcerated and subjected to harsher
   sentences, including life imprisonment without parole and the death
   penalty."[65][43] It specifically recommended that the US amend "laws
   and policies leading to racially disparate impacts in the criminal
   justice system" at all levels of government and implement "effective
   national strategies or plans of action aimed at eliminating structural
   discrimination."[66][44] In its 2021 submission, the US reported that
   the federal prison population had dropped to its lowest level since
   2000, "declining almost 31% since 2013,"[67][45] though it is worth
   noting that the federal prison population only represents about 10
   percent of the total US prison population.[68][46] Further, the federal
   prison population has grown under President Biden.[69][47] The US also
   cited the First Step Act, enacted by Congress in December 2018,[70][48]
   as central in making reductions possible. In its 2021 submission the US
   reported that of the total number of people who received reduced
   sentences as a result of the First Step Act, [71]91 percent were Black,
   which is consistent with the historic over-policing and overcharging of
   Black communities.[72][49] At the same time, the US failed to mention
   that its own Department of Justice (DOJ) found the risk assessment
   tool  the Prisoner Assessment Tool Targeting Estimated Risk and Needs
   (PATTERN) created by DOJ in connection with the First Step Act,
   resulted in racial disparities.[73][50] Despite repeated attempts at
   reform, the tool continues to overestimate the number of Black women
   who will engage in recidivism, compared to white women, and produces
   other racial disparities.[74][51]

   While some reforms have taken effect over the last decade, the US has
   failed to systematically address the immense breadth and depth of harm
   caused by its criminal legal system-harms that are the product of
   [75]deliberate [76]legal and policy choices created by a dominant white
   population supported by a culture of white supremacy.[77][52]

   US authorities hold almost two million people in detention and
   correctional facilities across the  [78]United States,[79][53] and they
   imprison Black people at a rate three times higher than [80]white
   people.[81][54] Black women are imprisoned [82]at a rate that is 1.7
   times the rate of white women.[83][55] While systemic discrimination
   against Black people is particularly blatant, the US also
   disproportionately punishes [84]Indigenous[85][56] and
   [86]Latinx[87][57] people.

   racialdiscrimination is also deeply woven into the policing and
   charging practices that harass, target, and subject Black people and
   other people of color to the most severe punishments available. One out
   of seven people in prison are [88]serving a life sentence,[89][58] and
   [90]nearly half of that group is Black.[91][59] US authorities continue
   to apply the death penalty both discriminatorily and arbitrarily.

   In 2021, more than half of people executed were Black, and
   approximately 60% of people sentenced to death were [92]Black or
   Latinx.[93][60] Nearly 200 people on death row have been [94]exonerated
   since 1972--1 for every 8.3 people executed.[95][61] In fact, both
   death-row exonerees in 2021 were Black men imprisoned in Mississippi
   for nearly three decades because of [96]false forensic
   testimony.[97][62]

   Mass incarceration harms not only those incarcerated,
   disproportionately people of color, but entire communities. About
   [98]half of adults in the US have had an immediate family member
   incarcerated in jail or prison.[99][63] Black people are 50 percent
   more likely to have experienced familial incarceration than whites, and
   they are three times as likely to have had a family member incarcerated
   for [100]a year or longer.[101][64] [102]Research also shows that
   nearly half of incarcerated people in state prisons and almost 60
   percent in federal prisons are parents with minor children,[103][65]
   and Black children are six times more likely than their white peers to
   have had a [104]parent behind bars.[105][66]

   One of the most damaging aspects of mass incarceration in the United
   States is the harm caused to incarcerated people by dangerous and
   degrading conditions in prisons, jails, and other places of detention.
   Practices such as [106]solitary confinement,[107][67] [108]denial of
   adequate medical and mental healthcare,[109][68] and [110]sexual and
   other violence[111][69] cause lasting injury, and sometimes death, to
   those exposed to them. Because of space limitations, this report does
   not discuss these conditions of confinement in detail, but they are an
   inseparable element of the harm caused by mass incarceration.

To address the discriminatory impact of mass incarceration, the US should:

     * Reduce the role of police in addressing societal problems
       (including homelessness, mental health, and poverty) and invest
       instead in community-based non-carceral solutions to such societal
       problems.
     * Abolish the death penalty and consider the elimination of life, and
       virtual life, sentences; eliminate sentence enhancements and
       minimum-time-served requirements; and expand access to
       early-release mechanisms such as good-time credits, parole, and
       clemency. These legal changes should be extended to offenses
       classified as violent and applied retroactively.
     * Invest in crime prevention programs and alternatives to
       incarceration including community-based crisis intervention
       services that are trauma-informed, culturally competent, and do not
       exclude offenses classified as violent.
     * Record, maintain, track, and publicly disseminate data on
       convictions, sentencing, and incarceration including racial and
       ethnic demographics.

Youth/Juvenile Justice

   The [112]ICERD requires States to "pay the greatest attention possible
   with a view to ensuring that [children from racial minorities] benefit
   from the special regime to which they are entitled in relation to the
   execution of sentences."[113][70] Other prominent human rights bodies
   have reinforced this message. The Committee on the Rights of the Child
   (CRC) has stated that "particular attention must be paid to de facto
   discrimination and [racial] disparities"[114][71] and urged states to
   provide "appropriate support and assistance" to reintegrate young
   people who commit crimes.[115][72] In its most recent recommendations
   to the US, the CERD urged the US to intensify efforts to address the
   "school-to-prison pipeline," ensure that young people are not placed in
   adult criminal settings, and abolish life-without-parole sentences for
   people under eighteen.[116][73]

   Racial inequities pervade every stage of the juvenile legal system.
   Black and brown young people are more likely than their white peers to
   be stopped and harassed by the police.[117][74] This increases the
   likelihood of future arrest: Black young people who come into contact
   with the police by eighth grade have eleven times greater odds of being
   arrested in young adulthood.[118][75] Once arrested, Black young people
   are four times as likely to be detained as white young people.[119][76]
   Black young people comprise just fifteen percent of the US youth
   population, but forty-one percent of those confined in juvenile
   facilities.[120][77] Black children are also disproportionately likely
   to be charged as adults.[121][78] Indeed, eighty percent of young
   people serving life sentences are children of color, and more than
   fifty percent are Black.[122][79] The traumas of incarceration--which
   are especially acute for children in adult prisons and include sexual
   abuse, solitary confinement, and death by suicide--therefore fall too
   often on children of color, especially Black youth.[123][80]

To address the discriminatory impact of policies criminalizing youth:

     * Provide supportive services for and investment in child-centered,
       trauma informed youth programs, education, and mental health care.
     * Refrain from prosecuting children in adult court, utilizing
       incarceration as a last resort after other interventions have been
       tried, and instead treat them as children, with a focus on
       opportunities for education, healing, and healthy development
       instead of punishment.

Criminalization of Poverty - Homelessness, Bail, Fines, and Fees

   Beyond the general requirement that "all public authorities and public
   institutions, national and local" eschew racial
   discrimination,[124][81] the ICERD contains provisions that bear
   specifically on homelessness and poverty. Article 5(e) of the
   Convention addresses discrimination in protections against unemployment
   and the provision of social security and social services.[125][82]
   Additionally, Article 5(f) articulates a "right of access to any place
   or service intended for use by the general public."[126][83] In 2014,
   the CERD expressed concern over the "high number of homeless persons,
   who are disproportionately from racial and ethnic minorities," and the
   "criminalization of homelessness through laws that prohibit activities
   such as loitering, camping, begging and lying down in public
   spaces."[127][84] The Committee recommended abolishing laws
   criminalizing homelessness, and "intensify[ing] efforts to find
   solutions for the homeless, in accordance with human rights
   standards."[128][85]

   Although the US has previously acknowledged the CERD's
   concerns,[129][86] the criminalization of homelessness remains a
   pressing social problem across the United States--and one that
   continues to burden people of color disproportionately. In 2020, there
   were an estimated 580,000 unhoused people in the United States, 39
   percent of whom were Black, despite only being 12 percent of the US
   total population.[130][87] Fifty-three percent of unhoused families
   with children were Black. Native American, Native Hawaiian, and Pacific
   Islander people made up 1 percent of the US population, but 5 percent
   of the unhoused.[131][88] Many localities persist in criminalizing the
   presence of homeless persons in public places[132][89]--in essence,
   punishing people for lacking a home by prohibiting sleeping outside,
   loitering, or requesting assistance from others.[133][90] For instance,
   in one town near Los Angeles, California, only 1.3 percent of the
   population is homeless, but that group received a staggering 26% of all
   citations issued in the town by the Los Angeles Sheriff's
   Department.[134][91] Zealous targeting of homeless populations
   essentially for being homeless inexorably feeds a vicious cycle of
   escalating enforcement, generating misdemeanors, warrants, unpayable
   fines, and incarceration.[135][92] The criminalization of homelessness
   now includes arrests, citations, and forced banishment of people
   through encampment clearances and property destruction by sanitation
   workers and police.[136][93] In cities like Los Angeles as well as
   elsewhere in the US, a long history of racialdiscrimination in
   housing, lending, employment, policing, and other factors (government
   policies like "urban renewal" and freeway construction included)  have
   led to high levels of Black homelessness.[137][94]

   Poverty implicates issues of concern to CERD outside the context of
   homelessness as well. The US has conceded that, within the criminal
   legal system, some rights are contingent upon ability to pay. Although
   variation occurs across US states, the US has noted that "persons with
   felony convictions may ... have to pay any outstanding fees, fines, or
   restitution before [voting] rights are restored" upon release from
   incarceration.[138][95] While this statement indicates some recognition
   of the problem, the federal government's current actions are inadequate
   to remedy the immense harm to poor individuals stemming from the
   criminal legal system, a system that keeps the already marginalized in
   poverty.[139][96] In its most recent response to the CERD, the US fails
   to address the crushing effects of fines and fees accompanying
   low-level infractions, the accumulation of which affect the poorest in
   society, who pay the vast majority of these penalties.[140][97] A study
   in Tulsa, Oklahoma found that Black residents were disproportionately
   subject to county-based warrants that are often issued for minor
   infractions such as failure to pay court costs, fines, and
   fees.[141][98] The threat of rearrest for one's inability to afford
   mounting debt keeps people in a cycle of incarceration and forces
   families to decide between paying fines and fees and purchasing
   necessities such as diapers and formula for their
   children.[142][99]^Mothers are separated for lengthy periods of time
   from their children as a result of being held in custody, sometimes
   lengthened due to the fines and fees.[143][100]

   Furthermore, pretrial incarceration, often ordered by judges setting
   unaffordable money bail, disproportionately harms low-income and
   low-wealth people of color. In the case of bail, wealthy defendants are
   more able to secure their freedom while poor ones are forced to remain
   incarcerated, affecting their livelihoods and family ties.[144][101]
   Pretrial incarceration leads to increased likelihood of convictions and
   harsher sentences.[145][102] People held in jail pretrial are
   pressured to plead guilty to secure their release, regardless of their
   actual guilt or innocence.[146][103] Additionally, pretrial
   incarceration can result in even more fines and fees, as some jails
   bill detained people for each day of their detention.[147][104] These
   inequalities have troubling racial implications, as Black people are
   2.5 times more likely than white people to live in poverty and face
   much higher arrest rates.[148][105]

To address the criminalization of poverty, US states should:

     * Stop criminalizing homelessness and its inevitable consequences,
       which only further serves to penalize disadvantaged individuals
       already suffering from inadequate allocation of governmental
       resources.
     * Reduce the circumstances in which courts can order pretrial
       incarceration, through bail setting or other means, only to those
       in which there is strong evidence of imminent harm if a person is
       released pretrial, and only following a rigorous hearing to
       evaluate that evidence.
     * Invest in pretrial services programs providing court date
       reminders, transportation, and other support to ensure court
       appearances.
     * Drastically reduce the number and amounts of fines and fees in the
       US criminal legal system. Further, establish national standards for
       criminal-legal system debt, including guidelines on ability- to-
       pay determinations and collection practices.

Probation and Parole

   Probation and parole are portrayed as alternatives to incarceration,
   but in reality they drive high numbers of people--particularly Black
   and brown people--into jail and prison.[149][106] About 4 million
   people in the US are on probation or parole,[150][107] and nearly half
   of all state prison admissions stem from violations of the conditions
   of probation or parole.[151][108] Black people are 4.15 times more
   likely to be under supervision than white people, and remain on
   supervision longer than similarly situated whites.[152][109]

   Black people are also more likely to be incarcerated for supervision
   violations. Due to generations of structural racism, Black and brown
   people are less likely to have resources, such as housing, wealth,
   reliable transportation, and jobs, that make it feasible to complete
   the onerous requirements of supervision.[153][110] Meanwhile, they are
   disproportionately stopped, searched, and arrested by police--making
   them more likely to be incarcerated for probation or parole
   violations.[154][111] And some supervision conditions--such as
   requirements to stay away from people with felony
   records--disproportionately burden Black men, one in three of whom have
   a felony conviction.[155][112]

To address racial disparities in probation and parole, US authorities should:

     * Drastically reduce the use of supervision sentences for youth and
       adults and instead utilize real alternatives to incarceration.
     * Where supervision is used, shorten supervision periods, narrowly
       tailor conditions, and stop incarcerating people for violations
       that would not otherwise be a crime.

Reentry Issues - Impact of Criminal Records on Housing and Unemployment

   The ICERD requires States to take "special and concrete measures to
   ensure the adequate development and protection of certain racial groups
   or individuals belonging to them, for the purpose of guaranteeing them
   the full and equal enjoyment of human rights and fundamental
   freedoms,"[156][113]^including the right to work and the right to
   housing.[157][114] The Committee has raised concerns about persistent
   housing and employment racial disparities in the US.[158][115]

   The United States imposes more than 48,000 legal restrictions on people
   with criminal records--barring them from work, housing, jobs, and civic
   engagement.[159][116] These barriers disproportionately impact Black
   and brown people, who are more likely to have criminal
   records[160][117] and to face discrimination when attempting to access
   housing and employment.[161][118] Sixty-four percent of unemployed men
   in their thirties have criminal records, and Black men are almost twice
   as likely as white men to be unemployed.[162][119]

   Additionally, the high rate at which the US subjects Black people to
   correctional control results in their underrepresentation in the US
   electorate, as many US jurisdictions deny voting rights to people on
   probation and parole, and nearly all deny those rights to people in
   prison.[163][120]

To address racialdiscrimination in re-entry, US jurisdictions should:

     * Repeal US laws allowing and facilitating discrimination and/or
       exclusions based solely on an individual's arrest or conviction,
       including restrictions or exclusions from employment, housing,
       access to social benefits, and voting.

Racist Drug Laws and Racism in Public Health Approaches

   The ICERD guarantees the right to equal treatment generally and, under
   Article 2(c), requires States Parties to "take effective measures to
   review governmental, national and local policies, and to amend, rescind
   or nullify any laws and regulations that have the effect of creating or
   perpetuating racialdiscrimination wherever it exists."[164][121] In
   its General Recommendation XXXI, the CERD recommended that States "pay
   the greatest attention" to "proportionately higher crime rates
   attributed to persons belonging to [racial minorities], particularly as
   regards petty street crime and offenses related to drugs" as an
   indication of the "non-integration of such persons into
   society."[165][122] Additionally, the Joint United Nations Programme on
   HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS) has called for the "decriminalization of drug
   possession for personal use" and the "elimination of stigma and
   discrimination against people who use drugs."[166][123] In its 2014
   concluding observations to the US, the CERD expressed concern over "the
   application of mandatory minimum drug-offense sentencing policies" that
   exacerbate racial disparities in the criminal legal system.[167][124]
   Additionally, the UN Special Rapporteur on extreme poverty and human
   rights highlighted the "confused and counterproductive drug policies"
   in the US in his 2018 country report. The report described how, in the
   context of drug addiction in the US, the "main responses have been
   punitive," rather than the appropriate response of "increased funding
   and improved access to vital care and support."[168][125] The report
   further suggested that this "urge to punish" has "racial undertones,"
   noting the disparities in sentencing between Black users of crack
   cocaine and white users of opioids.[169][126] Similarly, the UN Working
   Group of Experts on People of African Descent has urged the US to amend
   any judicial policies that disproportionately target Black people,
   stating that "the war on drugs has operated more effectively as a
   system of racial control than as a mechanism for combating the use or
   trafficking of narcotics."[170][127]

   In its 2021 report to the CERD, the US pointed to the 2018 enactment of
   the First Step Act, a law that reduced racial disparities in sentences
   for certain drug crimes.[171][128] While these reforms are helpful,
   they do not do nearly enough to remedy past discriminatory treatment or
   change laws, policies and practices in ways that would prevent it in
   the future.

   Nearly 400,000 people are in prison for drug crimes.[172][129] The vast
   majority of individuals incarcerated in federal prison are there on a
   drug charge,[173][130] and by some estimates, nearly eighty percent of
   people in federal prison for drug offenses are Black or
   Latinx.[174][131] Though Black and white people use drugs at similar
   rates,[175][132] Black people are imprisoned for drug crimes at five
   times the rate of white people.[176][133] "Black people [a]re arrested
   at over three times the rate of white people, and up to eight times as
   often in some states," for marijuana offenses.[177][134] Additionally,
   police have targeted Black people specifically for federal prosecution,
   because "federal drug laws carry harsher punishment--including
   mandatory minimum sentences--than charges brought in state
   court."[178][135] Though some authorities have begun to embrace a less
   punitive, more health-based approach to substance use disorders, this
   shift is still far too limited, and only began to take place after
   years of especially harsh treatment of Black people as part of the War
   on Drugs amidst an opioid crisis associated primarily with white
   people.[179][136] Further, drug arrests-the vast majority for
   possession-remain the leading cause of arrest in the US.[180][137]

   Black people have in fact been hit the hardest by the opioid crisis in
   recent years, one that has only worsened since the Covid-19 pandemic
   began. One study shows a thirty-eight percent increase in overdoses
   among Black people between 2018 and 2019 across four states.[181][138]
   Additionally, some states have responded to the opioid crisis by
   passing drug-induced homicide laws, which seek to charge people with
   murder for selling drugs that may have led to an overdose. Such laws
   can result in the disproportionate prosecution of Black and Latinx
   people--providing another basis for subjecting individuals of color to
   lengthy prison terms for drug-related offenses.[182][139]


To make drug policy more rights-respecting, the US should:

     * Eliminate mandatory minimum sentences for drug offenses and repeal
       drug-induced homicide laws.
     * End sentencing disparities between crack cocaine and powder cocaine
       offenses.
     * Decriminalize possession of drugs for personal use.
     * Enact laws or otherwise encourage processes to review and clear
       past drug convictions, including a process to expunge convictions
       for marijuana sales as marijuana is legalized for sale and a means
       to invest resources obtained from marijuana licensing to
       communities most harmed by past prohibitions on marijuana.
     * Invest in treatment and harm-reduction programs to provide
       trauma-informed and culturally competent support to people living
       with substance use disorders.

Prison Labor

   ICERD Article 5 includes the rights to work, free choice of employment,
   just and favorable conditions of work, equal pay for equal work, and
   just and favorable remuneration.[183][140] Further, the guidelines for
   prison labor set out in the UN Standard Minimum Rules for the Treatment
   of Prisoners (the "Rules") prohibit work "of an afflictive nature,"
   require permitting incarcerated people to "choose the type of work they
   wish to perform," and mandate that such labor be supplemented with
   vocational training.[184][141] The Rules also state that the
   "precautions laid down to protect the safety and health of free workmen
   shall be equally observed in [correctional] institutions," and that
   "[p]rovision shall be made to indemnify prisoners against industrial
   injury, including occupational disease, on terms not less favorable
   than those extended by law to free workmen."[185][142]

   Almost one million people are currently working while confined in US
   prisons.[186][143] They often work in grueling and degrading conditions
   for little to no pay--often pennies on the hour--and under threat of
   punishment (including solitary confinement) for refusing to
   work.[187][144] US law explicitly excludes incarcerated workers from
   the most basic workplace safety guarantees, including the
   constitutional prohibition against involuntary servitude.[188][145]^The
   US prison labor system involves present-day involuntary servitude.
   Prison labor is also a legacy of slavery, and racial inequities persist
   today.[189][146] Black people are disproportionately incarcerated and
   thus overrepresented among those working in prison.[190][147] Black
   people also work lower-wage and unpaid agriculture and maintenance jobs
   at a disproportionate rate in prison, while a higher proportion of
   white people work in higher-paying prison-industries jobs.[191][148]
   Indeed, across the deep south, agricultural workers, largely Black,
   pick and harvest crops in prisons located on the sites of former slave
   plantations.[192][149]

To eliminate racial inequities in prison labor, the US should:

     * Abolish the Thirteenth Amendment's exclusion that allows forced
       labor as a punishment for a crime.
     * Ensure that all work in prisons is fully voluntary by eliminating
       any laws and policies enabling forced labor and that punish
       incarcerated people who are unable or unwilling to work.
     * Adopt legislation and regulations providing incarcerated workers in
       all prisons with the same labor protections afforded to other US
       workers including minimum wage, overtime pay, health and safety
       standards, unionization and collective bargaining, and protection
       from discrimination and retaliation.
     * Initiate oversight investigations into federal and state prisons to
       eliminate forced labor of incarcerated people and discriminatory
       pay, allocation of work assignments, conditions, and related
       practices.



racialdiscrimination and Excessive Force by Law Enforcement Officials

Racially-Disparate Policing and Enforcement Practices

   Article 5(b) of the ICERD requires States Parties to ensure equity in
   the right to be free from "violence or bodily harm, whether inflicted
   by government officials or by any individual group or
   institution."[193][150] Accordingly, the CERD has called on States
   Parties to improve the training of their law enforcement officials, and
   it has long expressed concern about police profiling, bias and
   brutality^(as well as attendant impunity) that disproportionately harms
   people of color in the United States.[194][151] The Committee even
   issued an Early Warning and Urgent Action Procedures Resolution after
   the police murder of George Floyd sparked unprecedented protests
   against police violence in 2020.[195][152]

   Despite warnings from the Committee and other international human
   rights bodies,[196][153] US police agencies have failed to meet their
   obligations under the ICERD. The US has discussed bringing federal
   lawsuits against problematic police agencies[197][154] and proposed
   some federal legislation that may (if passed) help to address some of
   these issues,[198][155] but legislation failed in the US Senate, and
   the executive order President Biden passed in response does not go
   nearly far enough to save lives.[199][156]

   People of color continue to bear the brunt of aggressive and
   discriminatory policing. Estimates attribute over 1,000 killings per
   year to the police,[200][157] and new research suggests that more than
   half of police killings are not reflected in official
   statistics.[201][158] Police also continue to kill Native Americans,
   Latinxs and Black people at significantly higher rates--as much as 350%
   more frequently--than white people.[202][159] Even greater racial
   disparities attend nonfatal uses of force by police,[203][160] and
   police likewise target people of color (especially Black people) for
   stops and arrests at much higher rates than white people.[204][161] The
   goal of limiting police violence in the US is linked to the need to
   correct imbalances between investment in services that directly address
   societal problems such as substance use disorders or poverty and
   investment in policing.[205][162]

   These substantial, persistent imbalances notwithstanding, impunity for
   abuse remains a widespread problem.[206][163] There are over 18,000
   policing agencies across the US,[207][164] but the US Department of
   Justice opened only 70 civil investigations into police departments for
   the possible violation of civilians' rights between 1994 and January
   2020.[208][165] More broadly, police rarely face prosecution or other
   legal consequences after engaging in brutality.[209][166] Additionally,
   much of the data needed to discern the extent of police compliance with
   the ICERD remain undisclosed.[210][167] For instance, federal efforts
   to create a use-of-force database for police have faltered due to
   widespread noncooperation from police departments-though President
   Biden's executive order on policing aims to address this
   problem.[211][168] In many US states, the disciplinary records of
   abusive officers are also largely hidden from the public,[212][169] and
   civil society groups and universities have had to take it upon
   themselves to cobble together a national database on police stops of
   civilians.[213][170]

To address excessive use of force in law enforcement, the US should:

     * Prohibit police from enforcing a range of non-serious offenses,
       including issuing fines and making arrests for non-dangerous
       behaviors, thus eliminating many of the unnecessary interactions
       between the police and community members that have led to so much
       violence and so many deaths.
     * Invest in communities to prioritize health and quality of life over
       law enforcement and surveillance.
     * Implement enforceable legal constraints so that there will be only
       rare instances in which police officers can legally use force
       against community members;
     * Create independent oversight structures with robust enforcement and
       subpoena powers that ensure that when officers use force in
       violation of the law, policies, or training, they are held
       accountable.

Racial Bias and Abuse by Law Enforcement in Immigration Control

   ICERD's prohibition of discrimination, including in Article 5(b) also
   bears on law enforcement at the US border and in interior immigration
   enforcement.[214][171] The CERD has recommended that "all officials
   dealing with non-citizens receive special training, including training
   in human rights," to combat ill-treatment and discrimination against
   non-citizens by police and law enforcement agencies.[215][172] In its
   2008 concluding observations to the US, the CERD expressed concern over
   the excessive use of force against migrants, recommending that the US
   establish "adequate systems for monitoring police abuses" and develop
   "further training opportunities for law enforcement
   officials."[216][173] In 2014, the Committee went further, reiterating
   concern about "increased use of racial profiling" by law enforcement to
   determine immigration status and recommending an end to specified
   immigration enforcement programs,[217][174] including the Secure
   Communities program[218][175] and the INA $B!x(B 287(g) program.[219][176]
   The United States replied that Department of Homeland Security (DHS)
   policy prohibits racial profiling and that it issued new use of force
   policies and training.[220][177]

   Despite these policies and purported reforms, US Customs and Border
   Patrol (CBP) and Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officers
   continue to commit acts of violence and other serious abuses against
   migrants. Internal DHS reports revealed testimony regarding "over 160
   cases of misconduct and abuse of asylum applicants," including physical
   and sexual abuse.[221][178] Reports and statements from former CBP
   agents illustrate a departmental reluctance to "hold agents and others
   within the agency accountable."[222][179] Further, reports and images
   emerged in 2021 of "horse-mounted agents maneuvering their horses in a
   menacing way toward migrants, wielding lariats [whips], and using
   derogatory and xenophobic language" against primarily Haitian migrants,
   "including families with small children."[223][180] ACLU tracking has
   documented at least 230 fatal encounters with CBP since the agency was
   created.[224][181] Finally, while President   Biden's administration
   has attempted to limit deportations of people from the interior of the
   United States through an initial moratorium on deportations and
   subsequent "enforcement priorities" memos, [225][182] it has maintained
   programs that facilitate racial profiling in immigration enforcement
   such as the 287(g) program, Operation Stonegarden and the Secure
   Communities program, the 287(g) program is still widespread across the
   country. Through these programs, the Biden administration is partnering
   with xenophobic, anti-immigrant law enforcement agencies across the
   countries, including those with extensive records of civil rights
   violations.[226][183]

To address racialdiscrimination by law enforcement in border control and
interior immigration enforcement:

     * Federal, state, and local authorities should reduce their reliance
       on policing agencies and instead adopt a humanitarian approach to
       border reception and regulation, ensuring for example the primacy
       of human dignity, due process, family unity, non-discrimination,
       and the right to seek asylum.
     * The US should immediately review, investigate, and remedy all
       internal and external allegations of abuse by government officials
       at the border or in an immigration detention facility and initiate
       an investigation of a pattern and practice of rights violations by
       CBP. In addition, the US government should immediately end
       immigration detention that is unnecessary or prolonged with the aim
       to gradually abolish immigration detention and should close any
       immigration detention facility in which persistent abuses are
       committed.[227][184]
     * The US should end immigration programs that facilitate racial
       profiling, including the 287(g), Operation Stonegarden, and Secure
       Communities programs.



racialdiscrimination in the Regulation and Enforcement of Migration and
Refugee Laws

   ICERD protects non-citizens against discrimination on the basis of
   race, colour, descent, and national or ethnic origin, regardless of
   whether they are lawfully admitted to the territory of a State Party.
   The text of the Convention does not explicitly prohibit differential
   treatment on the basis of citizenship, but the CERD has clearly stated
   that, "differential treatment on the basis of citizenship or
   immigration status will constitute discrimination" under the Convention
   "if the criteria for such differentiation . . . are not applied
   pursuant to a legitimate aim, and are not proportional to the
   achievement of this aim."[228][185] Article 5 of ICERD further binds
   parties to eliminate discrimination and guarantee equality before the
   law in relation to several rights fundamental to non-citizens,
   including the right to equal treatment before tribunals, the right to
   freedom of movement within the borders of a state, and the right to
   leave any country, including one's own.[229][186] Article 6
   additionally requires States Parties to "assure to everyone within
   their jurisdiction effective protection and remedies" for instances of
   discrimination; this extends to non-citizens as well as
   citizens.[230][187]

   The United States has long acknowledged that "discrimination against
   immigrants" is one of the principal causative factors of the "subtle
   and elusive" forms of discrimination that "persist[s] in American
   society."[231][188] Indeed, the United States' combined first, second,
   and third report noted that there is a long history of "discriminatory
   provisions in US immigration law and policy," dating to the 19th
   century.[232][189] Notwithstanding the passage of anti-discrimination
   laws protecting non-citizens in and since 1965, the government has
   confirmed that "recent immigrants often encounter discrimination in
   employment, education, and housing as a result of persistent racism and
   xenophobia."[233][190] According to the United States, discrimination
   against non-citizens has not meaningfully abated or diminished since it
   became a party to ICERD; indeed, in its combined fourth, fifth, and
   sixth periodic reports, the United States noted an "increase in bias
   crimes and related discriminatory actions against persons perceived to
   be Muslim, or of Arab, Middle Eastern, or South Asian
   descent."[234][191] In its most recent report, the United States
   highlighted an additional threat from violent domestic extremists
   driven by "long-standing racial and ethnic tension, including
   opposition to immigration."[235][192]

   The CERD has made a series of recommendations about how the United
   States should more effectively protect non-citizens from
   discrimination. In 2014, the Committee called on the United States to
   ensure that the rights of non-citizens, "are fully guaranteed in law
   and in practice," including by "abolishing `Operation Streamline' [a
   program of mass criminal prosecution of migrants for unauthorized entry
   and reentry] and dealing with any breaches of immigration law through
   [a] civil, rather than criminal immigration system"; undertaking
   "thorough and individualized assessment concerning detention and
   deportation and guaranteeing access to legal representation in all
   immigration-related matters";[236][193] reviewing "laws and regulations
   in order to protect migrant workers from exploitative and abusive
   working conditions"; and ratifying several International Labor
   Organization conventions.[237][194] As set out below, the US has failed
   to implement these recommendations and has both failed to protect
   migrants from prohibited discrimination and actively contributed to
   worsening of the discriminatory situation since last undergoing CERD
   review.

   Multiple United States federal district courts have recently deemed the
   racist, xenophobic history of the US criminal reentry statute (one of
   two laws used in Operation Streamline) as relevant in analyzing the
   statute's application; one judge dismissed criminal charges based on a
   finding that the law was originally "enacted with discriminatory
   purpose"-indeed, would not have been enacted absent racial animus-and
   "has a disparate impact on Latinx persons."[238][195] Despite the
   CERD's recommendation that the US regulate migration exclusively as a
   civil and not a criminal matter, the United States continues to
   prosecute criminal entry and reentry crimes under these laws.[239][196]

   Naked xenophobia has been a major factor in US immigration policy since
   the last CERD review of the United States. Most significantly, former
   President Donald Trump actively promoted discrimination against
   migrants through a range of changes to US immigration law and policy, a
   number of which President Biden continues to enforce.[240][197] Ongoing
   and increased discriminatory treatment of non-citizens have taken the
   form of efforts to restrict access to the United States; disparate
   treatment of migrants in the custody of US immigration authorities and
   in conferring immigration benefits; and the mistreatment of
   non-citizens by US state and local governmental authorities.

   Workplace protections under international human rights law apply to all
   workers, regardless of citizenship status. However, fear of
   retaliation, including deportation, causes many workers who are
   unauthorized, who have family members who are undocumented, or
   otherwise have tentative immigration status to hesitate to speak up in
   the workplace or report abusive employers and working
   conditions.[241][198] These fears therefore have a massive impact on
   Black and brown workers' rights to fair pay and decent work conditions
   to the right to organize.

To address racialdiscrimination against migrants, the US should:

     * Conduct a thorough review of all current immigration laws to
       determine racial or discriminatory motivations or effects. Repeal
       or reform immigration laws enacted to effectuate racial animus or
       those with a racially discriminatory impact.[242][199]
     * Establish a mechanism providing full and effective reparation,
       proportional to the gravity of the violation and the harm suffered,
       to those who were subjected to discriminatory expulsion, family
       separation, prosecution and imprisonment, arbitrary detention,
       detention in inhumane conditions or other rights violations as a
       result of the racially discriminatory impact of US immigration
       laws.

Restrictions on Entry and Access to Territory

   In the reporting period there have been three particularly significant
   policies imposing discriminatory restrictions on entry and access to
   territory. First, the "discriminatory bans" (often called the "Muslim
   bans") on entry to the United States that first targeted "primarily
   Muslim countries"[243][200] and then "African countries."[244][201] In
   January 2021, the United States officially acknowledged that there were
   "discriminatory bans" on entry to the United States, which had been
   implemented by former President Trump and rescinded by President Biden.
   Commentators have pointed to the way in which anti-Muslim animus long
   operated as a form of racialdiscrimination in the US immigration
   system, prior to these bans on entry.[245][202] While the current
   administration rescinded the "discriminatory bans," the administration
   has failed to adequately remedy past discriminatory exclusions
   implemented under the policy and the ongoing consequences of the
   discriminatory order for migrants currently seeking to enter the
   US.[246][203]

   Second, the "migrant protection protocols" (MPP) (also known as "Remain
   in Mexico") policy forces migrants and asylum-seekers attempting to
   enter the United States at the US-Mexico land border to remain outside
   the US until an administrative proceeding is held to consider their
   status.[247][204] This results in harm in Mexico, heightened risk of
   refoulement to the country of origin and inadequate access to
   administrative proceedings including asylum hearings (in fact, in many
   instances, rulings by US immigration authorities occur in absentia,
   resulting in a denial of due process rights).[248][205] The MPP mostly
   affects those nationalities that Mexico refused to permit the US to
   expel under Title 42 (see below), including Central Americans, Cubans,
   Ecuadorians, and Venezuelans. Additionally, human rights reporting has
   established that migrants subjected to this policy face discriminatory
   treatment in Mexico.[249][206] This includes, for example, indigenous
   migrants who do not speak Spanish as their primary language and face
   mistreatment in Mexico.[250][207] While the Biden administration
   attempted to end this policy, a lawsuit brought by conservative
   governors in Texas and Mississippi forced the administration to
   reinstate it.[251][208] On June 30, 2022, the US Supreme Court-which
   did not review how the program exposed migrants to discrimination-held
   that the Biden Administration is able to end the program.[252][209]

   The third discriminatory policy involves the expulsion of
   asylum-seekers who approach the southern land border under a dated
   public health directive codified at Title 42 of the US Code. Title 42,
   when applied in this manner, conflicts with the right to seek asylum
   set out in Title 8; nonetheless the government continues to use this
   public health law to expel asylum-seekers.[253][210] The United States
   has carried out over 1.2 million expulsions under Title 42, a practice
   that has disproportionately impacted Black, Indigenous, and Latinx
   asylum-seekers, particularly from Central America, Africa, and Haiti as
   these migrants typically cannot access visas to enter the US via air
   travel).[254][211] In one high-profile instance, after a large number
   of Haitian asylum-seekers arrived in Del Rio, Texas in September 2021,
   the Biden administration sent a series of Title 42 expulsion flights to
   Haiti, exposing well over 10,000 asylum-seekers to conditions the US
   government previously recognized as being too dangerous and precarious
   for safe return.[255][212] In 2021, CBP officers were videotaped
   whipping Haitian asylum-seekers from horseback.[256][213] The use of
   Title 42 denies vast numbers of asylum-seekers arriving at the border
   the opportunity to demonstrate their claim of persecution and/or
   challenge their refoulement.[257][214] Title 42 expulsions stand in
   stark contrast to the actions the Biden administration has taken to
   grant exemptions to the application of Title 42 for the (primarily
   white) people fleeing from Ukraine.[258][215] Aspects of Title 42 are
   being litigated in various cases and the US Court of Appeals for the
   District of Columbia Circuit has held that aspects of the policy are
   likely unlawful, although not on the basis of disparate or
   discriminatory impact.[259][216]

To address discriminatory restrictions on entry and access to territory, the
US should:

     * Ensure non-discriminatory access to US territory and to individual
       status determination procedures run by US officials with
       trauma-informed training in US asylum law and whose mission is
       humanitarian and not focused on border security.
     * Repeal and replace orders, statutes, and regulations that have been
       used to exclude and/or expel migrants and asylum-seekers in a
       discriminatory manner.
     * Publicly track and report data demonstrating the effect of border
       policies by race and ethnicity.

Border Enforcement, Detention, and the Granting of Immigration Benefits

   In addition to border policies seeking to prevent migrants and
   asylum-seekers from ever setting foot in the United States, US
   immigration enforcement at the border and in the interior of the US has
   a disparate impact on the basis of race. This is caused in part by the
   failure of US constitutional interpretation to prohibit racial
   profiling in immigration enforcement and the continued reliance on
   racial profiling in border and national security enforcement.[260][217]
   It is also the product of the intersection between structural
   discrimination in the US criminal legal system and deportation law. One
   recent study, reviewing over 13,000 stops by law enforcement officials
   in the US State of Michigan, found clear evidence that CBP uses "racial
   profiling to target immigrants from Latin America and other people of
   color."[261][218] As Arnulfo Gomez described in relation to one such
   stop, "there was no reason for us to have been pulled over just because
   of the color of our skin. Everything that happened to us was wrong. We
   were being targeted just because we are Hispanic."[262][219]

   Another recent study found that Black immigrants are more likely to be
   detained in connection with criminal convictions than the immigration
   population overall and ultimately more likely to be removed due to a
   criminal conviction, often despite having lived in the United States
   for long periods and having strong community ties.[263][220] Evidence
   demonstrates that the United States consistently returns Black and
   Latinx migrants to countries where they are at risk.[264][221]

   Once apprehended, asylum-seekers and other migrants are subjected to
   prolonged and arbitrary immigration detention, often in abusive
   conditions and without adequate health care. Most migrants are also
   forced to navigate civil proceedings related to their status without
   legal representation. The United States operates the largest
   immigration detention system in the world. On a given day, tens of
   thousands of immigrants are detained on the basis of their status as a
   migrant.[265][222] US law mandates detention in many cases.[266][223]
   Myriad reports have documented the abysmal conditions to which
   immigration detainees are subjected.[267][224] Many detention
   facilities are operated by private corporations under contracts with
   the US government; approximately [268]80 percent of immigrant detainees
   are held in detention facilities owned or operated by private prison
   companies.[269][225] Research has shown that failures by ICE aggravated
   the risk of Covid-19 infections and that ICE transfers of detainees
   without prior testing effectively amplified contagion.[270][226]
   Detainees who have protested unsafe living conditions, including
   through the use of hunger strikes, have been subjected to retaliation,
   violence, and involuntary medical procedures, including force feeding
   and forced urinary catheterization.[271][227] While the US does not
   adequately make available relevant data disaggregated by race or
   ethnicity, Black and brown migrants are disparately impacted by the
   harms of immigration detention. While [272]Black immigrants make up
   only 4.8% of detained immigrants facing deportation before the
   Executive Office for Immigration Review (EOIR), they make up 17.4% of
   detained immigrants facing deportation before the EOIR on criminal
   grounds.[273][228] Data shows that ICE disproportionately places Black
   migrants in solitary confinement and subjects them to
   disproportionately long periods in detention.[274][229]

   The US represented to CERD that it had made changes in response to the
   Committee's 2014 recommendations regarding legal counsel and
   individualized status assessments, noting that ICE hired a "Legal
   Access Coordinator" who seeks to "enhance detained individuals' access"
   to legal counsel.[275][230] The US, however, continues to constrain
   access to legal counsel for detained migrants, requiring them to
   "secure legal representation at their own expense, find pro bono
   representation," or navigate the system alone.[276][231] Moreover, a
   [277]recent report found that ICE systematically restricts the most
   basic modes of communication, such as in-person legal visits,
   telephones, and legal mail, that detained people need to use to connect
   with legal counsel.[278][232] The vast majority of detained immigrants
   are without counsel.[279][233] This is problematic not only because
   those detained are disproportionately Black and brown, but also because
   detained immigrants who have lawyers obtain relief from removal at a
   rate of more than ten times higher than those who do not.[280][234]
   Calls for universal representation have pointed out that provision of
   counsel can help eliminate bias and discrimination in the allocation of
   legal services.[281][235]

   ICERD's mandate that States Parties "take effective measures" to ensure
   that their policies accord with the treaty cannot be accomplished
   without accurate data. Unfortunately, the US government does not
   publish or collect adequate data about border deaths, distress calls,
   and other border enforcement actions, nor about immigration
   enforcement, detention, use of force incidents, removals, or DHS civil
   rights and civil liberties complaints or investigations. Such
   information should be collected and disaggregated by race, ethnicity,
   nationality, immigration status, gender, age, disability, and other
   criteria.

To address discrimination in border and immigration enforcement, the US
should:

     * Revise guidance on the use of racial profiling by federal law
       enforcement to eliminate the existing border and national security
       loopholes and prohibit discrimination based on actual or perceived
       race, ethnicity, religion, nationality, and English proficiency.
     * Gradually abolish immigration detention.
     * Repeal laws mandating detention and invest in community-based
       social services as alternatives to detention without furthering
       surveillance of immigrants as an alternative to detention.
     * Establish, by statute or regulation, binding minimum standards for
       conditions of detention.
     * Establish, by statute or regulation, access to government-provided
       counsel for all migrants in proceedings regarding their status as a
       migrant, and ensure timely and confidential access to in-person,
       telephone, and video conferencing as well as legal mail in
       detention.
     * Publicly track and report data demonstrating the effect of
       immigration enforcement and benefits policies by race, ethnicity,
       and other disaggregated bases.
     * Prioritize and facilitate country visits by the UN Special
       Rapporteur on the human rights of migrants and provide unimpeded
       access to all places of detention.

Actions by State and Local Governments

   Currently, one of the most high-profile areas of concern is immigration
   enforcement by certain US state and local governments.[282][236] In
   Texas, for example, the state governor claimed that the state is under
   threat from migrants "from countries you haven't even heard of before"
   and has repeatedly used the rhetoric of "invasion."[283][237] The
   state's Operation Lone Star, just one part of anti-immigrant actions
   taken by the state, has aggressively used selective enforcement of the
   misdemeanor offense of criminal trespass to justify the arrest and
   detention of thousands of alleged migrants in a newly created
   segregated criminal legal system with separate dockets, public defender
   assignments, jails, and booking facilities.[284][238] As of March 2022,
   Texas had deployed state troopers and mass-mobilized members of the
   National Guard, who made at least 208,000 arrests.[285][239] Affidavits
   of arresting officers reveal that arrests are based on racial and
   national origin profiling, repeatedly describing those arrested as
   "Hispanic" and "undocumented."[286][240] These criminal proceedings
   have resulted in prolonged detention in egregious conditions; many
   cases have been dismissed for lack of probable cause.[287][241] Most
   recently, in an aggressive escalation of these policies, the state of
   Texas announced it would [288]return those suspected of being migrants
   to the border, raising a host of legal concerns.[289][242]

To address racialdiscrimination at the border, US jurisdictions should:

     * Expand the federal investigation into discriminatory treatment of
       non-citizens under Operation Lone Star to encompass Texas' new EO
       authorizing state law enforcement officials target, arrest, and
       detain suspected migrants and transport them to the US-Mexico
       border.
     * Issue guidance from DHS to its components affirming a policy of
       non-cooperation between DHS and the Operation Lone Star trespass
       arrest program.
     * Take all measures, including litigation, to compel Texas to end
       Operation Lone Star and other discriminatory abuse of migrants.
     * Immediately end federal funding for the agencies and counties
       engaged in the abusive Operation Lone Star border initiative, even
       as the Justice Department conducts an inquiry into the operation.

racialdiscrimination in Public Services and Social Protection

   Article 5 of ICERD provides that "States Parties undertake to prohibit
   and to eliminate racialdiscrimination in all its forms and to
   guarantee the right of everyone" to economic and social rights,
   including protection against unemployment, the right to medical care,
   social security, social services, and education, and just conditions of
   work and equal pay for equal work. Article 2 of ICERD further requires
   concrete state action to eliminate disparities in economic rights.
   However, racial minorities in the United States continue to suffer a
   lack of economic security compared to their white counterparts.

   The median wealth of white households in the United States is
   significantly higher than that of Black, Indigenous, or Latinx
   households. This so-called racial wealth gap[290][243] has grown since
   the country ratified ICERD, and the median wealth of white households
   is now at least ten-times that of the median Black household.[291][244]
   A disproportionate share of people who are Black, Indigenous, Latinx,
   or immigrants live under the poverty line. The poverty rates of Black
   and Latinx people are twice as high than among white people.[292][245]

   US Census Bureau data from[293][246] September 2021 found that some 19
   million adults lived in households with insufficient food and 11.9
   million adults were behind on rent.[294][247] According to data from
   the US Department of Agriculture, 19.1% of Black households and 15.6%
   of Hispanic households experienced food insecurity in 2019, compared to
   7.9% of white Americans.[295][248]

   The Covid-19 pandemic has only deepened these sharp disparities. The
   impacts of the pandemic and the economic fallout have been widespread,
   but remain particularly prevalent among Blacks, Latinx, and other
   people of color.[296][249] Gaps in preparedness and response to the
   Covid-19 pandemic have disproportionately negatively burdened people of
   color,[297][250] which has deepened existing racial injustices in
   health care,[298][251] housing,[299][252] employment,[300][253]
   education,[301][254] and wealth accumulation.[302][255]

   Over the course of the pandemic, poverty fell overall due in part to
   the stimulus checks and unemployment benefits received by
   many.[303][256] But the little progress made toward economic parity
   over the last year has stalled, as relief measures[304][257]
   implemented in response to Covid-19 have been reduced, ended, or struck
   down by the courts. Today, the Black-white wealth gap[305][258] is as
   big as it was in 1968.[306][259]

   While the US has acknowledged these disparities, it has admitted to
   CERD that it has failed to invest sufficient resources to address them,
   leading to the persistence of deeply discriminatory health care,
   inadequate social safety nets, and segregated communities and schools.

Public Health during the Covid-19 Pandemic

   Article 5 of ICERD provides that "States Parties undertake to prohibit
   and to eliminate racialdiscrimination in all its forms" in the right
   to "public health" and "medical care"[307][260] and provide equal
   access to healthcare services.[308][261] CERD has specifically mandated
   that states address the disproportionate impact of the Covid-19
   pandemic on racial minorities.[309][262] Where there are persistent
   disparities, ICERD requires states to affirmatively adopt measures to
   address them.

   The Committee has expressed concern over the failure of the US to
   address racial disparities in access to affordable health care, as many
   states have opted out of the Medicaid expansion program, excluding
   substantial numbers of racial minorities. In addition, the Committee
   expressed concern that many states have explicitly excluded migrants
   from health care.[310][263] In 2014, it recommended that the US "take
   concrete measures" to ensure individuals, "in particular racial and
   ethnic minorities who reside in states that have opted out of" the
   Affordable Care Act (ACA) and migrants have "access to affordable and
   adequate health-care services."[311][264] CERD has recommended that the
   US eliminate steep racial disparities in sexual and reproductive
   health, collect data, and improve monitoring and accountability
   systems.[312][265] In the context of the Covid-19 pandemic, CERD has
   made clear that States are obligated to "ensure equal access" to
   medical care.[313][266]

   Black, Latinx, and Indigenous communities continue to suffer profound
   disparities in rates of chronic health conditions, health outcomes, and
   access to quality health care.[314][267] For example, these communities
   are disproportionately impacted both by diabetes and its negative
   health outcomes, and are especially vulnerable to the harmful human
   rights impact of insulin prices in the US.[315][268] The Covid-19
   pandemic has deepened existing racial injustices in health
   care[316][269]: minorities are more likely to suffer severe illness and
   die from Covid-19[317][270] and face barriers to vaccine
   access.[318][271]

   Black people suffer from particularly acute racial disparities in
   maternal mortality and cervical cancer rates.[319][272] The maternal
   mortality rate for Black women is three times higher than white women
   and rose further between 2019 and 2020, driven by significant increases
   in the maternal mortality rate of Black and Latinx women.[320][273]
   These deaths, and those from cervical cancer, are preventable. Indeed,
   in 2020, 194 countries committed to eliminating cervical cancer
   globally.[321][274] In the US, Black women are more likely than white
   women to have never been screened for cervical cancer, are diagnosed at
   a later stage, and have lower survival rates.[322][275] In the state of
   Alabama, Black women are nearly twice as likely to die of cervical
   cancer as white women.[323][276]

   Given this crisis in maternal mortality and access to care for people
   of color, the Supreme Court's recent decision in Dobbs v. Jackson
   Women's Health Organization to overturn the constitutional right to
   access an abortion in Roe v. Wade and related decisions will have a
   [324]particularly profound and deadly impact on people of
   color.[325][277] Black people have [326]higher-risk pregnancies, are
   more than four times as likely to have had abortions as white pregnant
   people, are more likely to miscarry or have stillbirths compared to
   white pregnant people,[327][278] and are more likely to live in states
   that restrict abortions.[328][279]

   Migrants also suffer from acute health disparities, and some have no
   access to health care at all. Although some local policies provide
   undocumented immigrants with health care,[329][280] the federal
   government continues to prevent undocumented and some legal immigrants
   from enrolling in ACA coverage and Medicaid.[330][281] The lack of
   access to adequate health care has exacerbated the effects of Covid-19
   for immigrants, particularly undocumented populations in frontline
   jobs.[331][282]

   State and federal prisons have failed to offer adequate health
   protection generally, and specifically against Covid-19. Covid-19
   incidence and mortality rates were consistently higher among the prison
   population than the overall US population in the first year of the
   pandemic, and the cumulative toll of Covid-19 has been several times
   greater among the prison population than the overall US
   population.[332][283] The US's response continues to be inadequate; in
   immigration detention centers, COVID-19 infections have increased by
   more than[333] 940 percent since January 2022, while ICE has only
   administered booster shots to 671 of the 22,000 people in ICE
   detention.[334][284] Given the rapid spread of the virus behind bars,
   and the racially disproportionate prison population, Black and Latinx
   people have been particularly vulnerable.[335][285] By May 2020, Black
   people accounted for 60% of Covid-19 deaths in the New York State
   prison system, despite comprising 48% of detainees.[336][286]

To eliminate racial disparities in public health, the US should:

     * Improve the affordability and availability of health insurance for
       low- and middle-income earners. In particular, consider legislation
       to expand coverage for existing social protection programs like
       Medicaid and Medicare. In the absence of such legislation, Congress
       should take appropriate short-term remedial measures.
     * Support community health workers and community-based approaches to
       reproductive health care that address healthcare access and the
       social determinants of health.
     * Establish inclusivity policies that: support linguistic and racial
       diversity, including in federally qualified health clinics; and
       acknowledge, confront, and seek to remedy historic and current
       experiences of racialdiscrimination in public health, including by
       creating an official, confidential, and accessible complaint
       mechanism for patients who use federally qualified health
       facilities.

Inadequate Social Safety Net

   ICERD requires states to guarantee the rights to social security and
   social services without distinction as to race,[337][287] and the
   Committee has made clear that States are obligated to eliminate all
   forms of racial inequities, whether intentional or not.[338][288]
   Despite these protections, Black and Latinx people continue to face
   underinvestment in social protection, which has contributed to profound
   disparities in poverty and economic security. While, in the past,
   America's public benefits system helped reduce and prevent poverty and
   racial disparities by providing basic economic, food, childcare, and
   housing support, thereby preventing the intergenerational transmission
   of poverty, it has weakened substantially over the past
   decades.[339][289]

   The inadequate support system has been driven by racial
   animus,[340][290] community violence,[341][291] and discriminatory
   government policies based on racist stereotypes[342][292] as well as
   federal delegation to states.[343][293] Although most safety net
   programs are federally funded, state control over program design,
   rules, and benefit levels has resulted in inconsistent protection and
   racial inequalities. Similar to problematic aspects of the Medicaid
   provision,[344][294] US regions with larger populations of color have
   weaker safety nets and higher rates of economic hardship.[345][295] For
   example, workers of color have higher unemployment rates and also are
   more likely to reside in states with weaker unemployment insurance
   systems and other safety net programs.[346][296]

   The Covid-19 pandemic exacerbated the economic disparities and
   underlying conditions driving these inequalities, as Black and Latinx
   communities have experienced more job losses (and ensuing loss of
   health insurance), higher rates of infection and mortality, and greater
   likelihood of evictions and hunger than their white
   counterparts.[347][297] Similarly, women are disproportionately
   impacted by the economic fallout of Covid-19[348][298] For example,
   40.8 percent of Black, non-Hispanic women and 44.6 percent of Latinas
   faced housing insecurity in mid-July 2020 compared to 15.4 percent of
   white, non-Hispanic men. These rates were higher for households with
   children (45.2 percent for Black, non-Hispanic women with children and
   48.8 percent for Latinas with children). In addition, in April 2020,
   less than half of the adult Black population was employed and the Black
   and white unemployment gap widened to 5.3 percentage points.[349][299]
   Only 36 percent of households earning under $50,000 that lost jobs
   received unemployment benefits.[350][300] Women, especially women of
   color, have disproportionately suffered from pandemic job
   losses.[351][301] As of late 2020, Black women's employment fell 18.2
   percent from its peak compared with 16.7 percent for white women. In
   September 2020, white women's employment recovered while Black women's
   employment remained low. Latina women have also experienced dramatic
   employment and labor force declines.

   Although the US issued stimulus checks and other relief, these measures
   could not repair the social safety net shredded by decades of budget
   cuts and draconian rules.[352][302] In addition, there were racial
   disparities in the provision of the Coronavirus Aid Relief, and
   Economic Security (CARES) Act economic impact payments.[353][303]
   Undocumented immigrants were also largely left without relief during
   the pandemic as they and other immigrants were ineligible for
   pandemic-related stimulus checks, temporary family assistance (TANF),
   and food stamps.[354][304] Many immigrants eligible for unemployment
   relief were effectively denied relief because many states failed to
   translate application forms and other essential documents.[355][305]
   Child poverty increased by 41 percent within a month after the US let
   its expanded child tax credit expire at the end of 2021, pushing 3.7
   million more children into poverty. Black and Latinx children
   experienced the highest percentage point increases in poverty, 5.9
   percent and 7.1 percent respectively.[356][306]

   Without effective social safety nets, families are also at risk of
   lengthy separation. Nationally, more than 75 percent of child welfare
   cases involve neglect, which occurs when a parent or caregiver fails to
   provide adequate food, clothing, shelter, or supervision to a
   child.[357][307] Instead of assisting families by providing cash, food,
   housing, or childcare assistance, the US child welfare system uses
   indicators of poverty as bases for removing children from
   families^while subsidizing and incentivizing foster care and adoption
   under the pretext of acting in the child's best interest. Due to
   systemic racism and other factors, this disproportionately impacts
   families of color.

To eliminate racialdiscrimination in the social safety net, the US should:

     * Increase benefit levels for social assistance and social insurance
       programs, including cash or in-kind assistance, including relevant
       tax credits like the Earned Income Tax Credit and Child Tax Credit,
       to ensure benefit adequacy, and consider adopting a universal
       income security program, such as a universal basic income.
     * Create federal standards optimizing eligibility for safety net
       programs. Where existing means-tested social assistance and
       insurance programs are not expanded universally, improve their
       eligibility requirements and accessibility. Means-tested programs
       should not include eligibility requirements that can unfairly
       exclude those in need, such as strict asset tests, or certain
       behavioral requirements like drug tests or work requirements.
     * Review and amend the current models used to create the annual
       Federal Poverty Guidelines to ensure that they are effectively
       capturing populations facing poverty.
     * Eliminate all benefit eligibility criteria for social protection
       programs tied to immigration status or criminal history.
     * Desist from using indicators of poverty as a basis for child
       removals, prolonged family separation, and termination of parental
       rights.
     * Create a federally funded system for paid family and medical leave.
     * Enforce Title VI of the Civil Rights Act against agencies that do
       not provide language access services or discriminate in the
       provision of benefits to minorities.

US Education Policy

   Article 2(2) of ICERD provides that States Parties shall take "special
   and concrete measures to ensure the adequate development and protection
   of certain racial groups ... , for the purpose of guaranteeing them the
   full and equal enjoyment of human rights and fundamental
   freedoms."[358][308] Quality education is central to the enjoyment of
   basic rights such as job procurement and political
   participation.[359][309] The CERD has underscored that barriers in
   education "results in the transmission of poverty from generation to
   generation" for people of African descent.[360][310]

   Discrimination and segregation in the education sector remain rampant
   across the US, driving inequality in education and in life
   opportunities.[361][311] Although the population is increasingly
   diverse, racial segregation in US schools is higher now than it has
   been in decades.[362][312] Majority-minority schools continue to be
   underfunded and fail to provide adequate educational opportunities to
   minority students.[363][313] US schools are primarily funded by
   neighborhood-specific property taxes, meaning that schools in poorer
   neighborhoods generate and receive less funding and resources than
   those in wealthier neighborhoods with higher property values.[364][314]
   Racial disparities in education's connection to US property tax
   policies built in part on racialdiscrimination, racial segregation,
   and the legacies of slavery has been widely recognized, including by
   some US courts.[365][315] Poor conditions in these schools-such as
   "missing or unqualified teachers, physically dangerous facilities, and
   inadequate books and materials"-correlate with lower student
   performance and low literacy rates, hampering minority individuals'
   ability to participate equally in democratic society.[366][316]

   In its 2008 and 2014 concluding observations addressed to the US, the
   CERD expressed concern about racial segregation in public schools,
   finding that prohibition of the use of race-conscious measures as a
   tool to promote integration inhibited progress.[367][317] The Committee
   found that students from racial and ethnic minorities attend segregated
   schools with unequal facilities, noting that even when students of
   color attend racially diverse schools, they are often relegated to
   "single race" classes, denied access to advanced courses, and unfairly
   disciplined.[368][318]^The Committee recommended that the US undertake
   a study to examine the reasons underlying de facto racial segregation,
   and "adopt all appropriate measures" to reduce the achievement gap
   between white and Black students "by improving the quality of education
   provided to [Black] students."[369][319] In 2014, the Committee
   [370]recommended that the US intensify its efforts to ensure equal
   access to education by taking measures including developing a concrete
   plan with goals and timelines to address racial segregation in schools
   and neighborhoods, and increasing federal funding for programs
   promoting racially integrated learning environments for
   students.[371][320]

   In its 2021 report to the CERD, the US made a number of claims
   regarding its efforts to promote diversity and equal opportunity in
   education,[372][321] including 2021 American Rescue Plan's
   funding[373][322] and other legislation,[374][323] as well as efforts
   by the Justice Department Civil Rights Division[375][324] and the
   Department of Education (DOE).[376][325] Nonetheless, the racial
   disparities in educational opportunities among students resulting from
   ongoing ICERD violations remain persistently and disturbingly high.

   The CERD has recommended that measures be taken to reduce the school
   dropout and suspension rates for children of African descent.[377][326]
   In its 2008 concluding observations, the Committee highlighted racial
   disparities in suspension and expulsion rates as exacerbating high
   dropout rates, as well as high rates of referrals of minority youth to
   the justice system.[378][327] The Committee expressed particular
   concern about school districts' use of "zero tolerance" school
   discipline policies and recommended that districts review these
   policies and seriously consider limiting suspensions and expulsions to
   the most serious cases of school misconduct, and recommended special
   training for school officers.[379][328]

   Nevertheless, disproportionate numbers of students of color continue to
   enter the criminal legal system. Schools with high populations of
   racial minority students have higher rates of suspension and expulsion,
   and students of color are more likely to be arrested as
   adults.[380][329] In addition, students of color face discriminatory
   [381]discipline and [382]criminalization.[383][330] Black students are
   [384]punished more frequently and harshly in all categories of school
   discipline, even though many schools have removed the term "zero
   tolerance" from their policies, driven in part by differential
   treatment and support at school by race.[385][331] A June 2021 report
   from the US Department of Education found that Black students are
   removed from school by being suspended or expelled (long term removal),
   and are referred to law enforcement at rates that are [386]more than
   twice their share of enrollment.[387][332] Students of color are more
   likely to go to a school with a law enforcement officer, more likely to
   be referred to law enforcement, and more likely to be arrested at
   school.[388][333]^In addition, students who attend schools with high
   percentages of Black students and students from low-income families are
   more likely face security measures like metal detectors, random
   "contraband" sweeps, security guards, and security cameras, even when
   controlling for the level of misconduct in schools or violence in
   school neighborhoods.[389][334]

   Article 7 of ICERD requires states to adopt immediate and effective
   measures, specifically in teaching, education, culture, and
   information, to promote tolerance and combat prejudice against
   national, racial, and ethnic groups. To combat prejudice and
   intolerance, the CERD has urged States to develop campaigns to educate
   the public about the history and culture of people of African descent
   and the importance of building an inclusive society.[390][335] The
   Committee has also urged affirmative efforts to ensure that textbooks
   contain "chapters about the history and cultures of peoples of African
   descent," and to "encourage and support the publication and
   distribution of books and other print materials, as well as the
   broadcasting of television and radio programs about their history and
   cultures."[391][336]^

   The US has [392]failed to implement these recommendations.[393][337]
   There are [394]no federal requirements or standards for teaching the
   history or racialdiscrimination in the US or about the history and
   cultures of Black Americans and other people of color, and only a
   handful of states mandate that such history be taught.[395][338] Even
   where mandates exist, each US state may teach in a way that leads to
   historical inaccuracies.[396][339] In the absence of any federal
   mandate, multiple states have introduced and enacted laws prohibiting
   schools from teaching about the reality of racism by banning "divisive
   concepts relating to race, racism and other topics."[397][340] Learning
   Black history is beneficial to all students: While enhancing the
   self-esteem of Black students, it conveys historical realities to all
   students and encourages empathy, understanding, and efforts to avoid
   repeating the racist violence of the past.[398][341] Further, denying
   the historical and contemporary realities of racialdiscrimination
   impedes not only justice and accountability for historic wrongs, but
   the eradication of persisting structures of racial inequality that is
   the core purpose of ICERD.

To address discrimination in the US education system, the US should:

     * Invest in underfunded schools to equalize public school funding
       throughout the US and continue to provide increased supplemental
       nutrition benefits for families with children during summer months
       when free or reduced-price school meals are not available.
     * Expand access to free, quality pre-primary education.
     * Expand the benefits of Pell Grants for low- and middle-income
       tertiary education students.
     * Adopt a federal national standard mandating the teaching of the
       colonization, including   forced displacement, dispossession, and
       mass killings of Indigenous peoples; the history of slavery, Jim
       Crow laws, lynchings, redlining, and segregation; civil rights
       movements; and other racial justice civil and labor rights
       movements.
     * The Justice Department and Education Department should enforce
       Title VI and relevant statutes to ensure non-discrimination in the
       implementation of such a national standard, and in particular,
       prohibit school districts or states from banning Critical Race
       Theory or from teaching about other forms of racialdiscrimination.

   [594][175] In jurisdictions where S-Comm is authorized, "any time an

   or her fingerprints are electronically run through ICE's immigration
   database." The program causes "widespread unlawful detention without
   criminal charges or a hearing" by targeting immigrants at the time of
   arrest, not conviction and it "ensnares huge numbers of low-level
   offenders and non-criminals," fueling mass deportations. "Secure

   [595][176] The 287(g) program allows "state and local agencies to act
   as immigration enforcement agents" through agreements with ICE. The
   agreements are designed to "extend the reach" of deportation procedures
   by "getting localities to do ICE's work at their own expense," and has
   led to "racial profiling, civil rights violations, isolation of
   immigrant communities, and family separation." "National Map of 287(g)

   and 2014, respectively, and that [599]CBP "redesigned its basic

   Torture, which provides authoritative interpretation of the CAT, is
   [637]clear that the duty not to return applies "equally" in cases where
   a government "is unable to prevent" acts of severe abuse committed by
   nonstate actors. Moreover, Haitians, Nicaraguans, Mexicans, and other
   asylum-seekers expelled by the United States to their home countries
   under Title 42 have consistently reported that they have been denied
   the opportunity to raise their fears of persecution or torture prior to
   their return. There is overwhelming evidence that the United States is
   failing to provide even the unduly restrictive so-called "shout test"
   to migrants under Title 42 (i.e., a chance for a referral if a migrant
   makes a "spontaneous and reasonably believable claim" that they fear
   being tortured). As of November 2021, only 3,217 migrants were referred
   for screening out of 1,163,000 border expulsions under Title 42 since
   March 2020; and of these, only 272 passed their initial screening
   interviews.

   an unacceptably high risk that a great many people deserving of asylum

   SEVENTY-SEVENTH SESSION, 54TH MEETING (PM)

   GA/12483

   Delegates Reject Country-Specific Texts as Political Tools to Interfere
   in Nations' Internal Affairs

   The General Assembly adopted 51 resolutions and 1 decision recommended
   by its Third Committee (Social, Humanitarian and Cultural) today,
   covering a range of issues, from the rights children, women, refugees
   and others forced to flee their homes, to combating the glorification
   of Nazism.

   Amid spirited debate, the Assembly adopted a draft on combating the
   glorification of Nazism by a recorded vote of 120 in favour to 50
   against, with 10 abstentions (Afghanistan, Ecuador, Myanmar, Palau,
   Panama, Papau New Guinea, Samoa, Switzerland, Republic of Korea and
   T?rkiye).

   The representative of the Russian Federation, describing the vote as
   shocking, said that, for the first time in the history of the United
   Nations, former Axis Powers voted against a text condemning Nazism.
   Criticizing a country-specific approach to a thematic resolution, he
   rejected amended operative paragraph 4, which condemns Moscow's
   military operation in Ukraine.

   Echoing his stance, China's delegate opposed attempts to distort the
   history of the Second World War. The practice of adding
   country-specific content to thematic resolutions by means of amendments
   is inconsistent with the established practice of the Third Committee,
   she noted. In the same vein, Sri Lanka's delegate criticized amended
   contents for politicizing the issue of combating racism and neo-Nazism
   through a country-specific approach.

   Meanwhile, Ukraine's delegate stressed that operative paragraph 4
   speaks about Moscow's endeavours to justify its military invasion and
   territorial aggression on the purported basis of eliminating
   neo-Nazism. "That is why we do not allow rapists to lecture us about
   how to fight rape," he emphasized, adding that the summary executions
   of civilians by the Russians in Ukraine -- documented in the report of
   the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights -- may constitute
   the war crime of wilful killing. This is the fascism of today -- the
   glorification of Nazism being executed by the Russian Federation -- he
   asserted.

   Along similar lines, the representative of the United States stressed
   that Moscow's resolution is not a serious effort to combat Nazism and
   antisemitism; instead, it is a shameful ploy to justify its war of
   aggression in Ukraine. In full support of the amendment that became a
   part of the resolution, she categorically rejected that the draft has
   turned into a country-specific resolution. The representative of the
   Czech Republic, speaking on behalf of the European Union, rejected the
   term denazification, used by the Russian Federation to justify its
   illegal invasion of Ukraine, adding that such distortion erodes
   understanding of the Holocaust.

   Also today, the Assembly passed five draft resolutions on
   country-specific situations. Numerous delegates broadly rejected
   country-specific texts, with Iran's delegate noting that such drafts
   are supported by countries with the darkest human rights records. The
   resolution on the situation in Iran does not concern the protection of
   human rights; instead, it aims to exert political pressure, she
   stressed, criticizing attempts to marginalize Iran through exploitation
   of United Nations mechanisms.

   Similarly, the representative of the Democratic People's Republic of
   Korea, condemning the draft on the human rights situation in his
   country, criticized the United States and Western countries for abusing
   human rights issues as a political tool for interfering in internal
   affairs of other countries.

   Three resolutions were adopted on questions relating to refugees,
   returnees and internally displaced persons. The text on the Office of
   the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) -- adopted by
   consensus -- had the Assembly express deep concern at the increasing
   number of people who are forcibly displaced due to conflict,
   persecution and climate. Stressing the importance of
   responsibility-sharing, the Assembly urged States to uphold the
   civilian and humanitarian character of camps for refugees and allow
   unhindered access for UNHCR.

   This year, the Assembly adopted by consensus a new text on protecting
   children from sexual exploitation. By its terms, the Assembly voiced
   concern over the threat posed by "self-generated" child sexual abuse
   materials produced through coercion, as well as linkages between child
   sexual exploitation and trafficking in children for commercial sexual
   exploitation. It urged States to criminalize all forms of child sexual
   exploitation and abuse, including online, and provide tools to identify
   victims and bring perpetrators to justice.

   A draft resolution on the world drug problem -- adopted by a recorded
   vote of 124 in favour to 9 against (Belarus, Cameroon, Iran, Nicaragua,
   Niger, Pakistan, Russian Federation, Syria and T?rkiye), with 45
   abstentions -- sparked controversy, with some delegates interpreting
   the text as a roll-over, while others refused to recognize it as the
   annual omnibus resolution due to extensive revisions.

   In its one decision of the day, the Assembly adopted the work programme
   of its Third Committee for the seventy-eighth session.

   Also speaking today were representatives of Nicaragua, Belarus, Saint
   Kitts and Nevis, Singapore, Cuba, Syria, Venezuela, Maldives,
   Philippines and Oman (on behalf of the Gulf Cooperation Council).

   The Assembly will next meet at 3 p.m. on Friday, 16 December, to
   continue its work.

   The General Assembly first took up the report on Social Development,
   which contains five draft resolutions.

   The Assembly then adopted draft resolution I on "Implementation of the
   outcome of the World Summit for Social Development and of the
   twenty-fourth special session of the General Assembly". By its terms,
   the Assembly expressed deep concern over persistent feminization of
   poverty, which increases vulnerability to trafficking in persons in
   least developed countries. It also expressed deep concern that the
   COVID-19 pandemic continues to have a devastating impact on sustainable
   development, disproportionately affecting people in vulnerable
   situations. Further, the Assembly urged Member States to strengthen
   social policies, paying attention to needs of marginalized social
   groups, including people living with HIV/AIDS, Indigenous Peoples and
   refugees.

   Next, the Assembly adopted draft resolution II on "Inclusive
   development for and with persons with disabilities" without a vote,
   expressing grave concern that persons with disabilities continue to
   experience intersecting forms of discrimination. It stressed the
   importance of mainstreaming the rights and participation of persons
   with disabilities into all relevant strategies and programmes for
   sustainable development. Further, it urged Member States to ensure that
   persons with disabilities and their families have access to support
   services and information on how to recognize and report exploitation,
   violence and abuse.

   The Assembly then adopted draft resolution III on "Follow-up to the
   Second World Assembly on Ageing" without a vote, expressing concern
   that health systems are not prepared to respond to the needs of the
   ageing population and that older persons rate of poverty has increased
   due to global economic crises. The Assembly expressed further concern
   that older women are at greater risk of physical and psychological
   abuse and violence, reiterating that their needs and perspectives must
   be considered in disaster risk reduction. The Assembly urged Member
   States to develop and strengthen programmes promoting healthy and
   active ageing and the prevention and control of non-communicable
   diseases for older persons.

   The Assembly then adopted draft resolution III on "Follow-up to the
   Second World Assembly on Ageing" without a vote, (document
   A/C.3/L.10/Rev.1), expressing concern that health systems are not
   prepared to respond to the needs of the ageing population and that
   older persons' rate of poverty has increased due to global economic
   crises. The Assembly expressed further concern that older women are at
   greater risk of physical and psychological abuse and violence,
   reiterating that their needs and perspectives must be considered in
   disaster risk reduction. The Assembly urged Member States to develop
   and strengthen programmes promoting healthy and active ageing and the
   prevention and control of non-communicable diseases for older persons.

   Adopting draft resolution IV on "Preparations for and observance of the
   thirtieth anniversary of the International Year of the Family" without
   a vote, the Assembly called on Member States to support working parents
   through, inter alia, expanded child and family benefits as well as paid
   family and sick leave. It further called on Member States and United
   Nations bodies to provide information on their activities, including
   good practices at the national level.

   The Assembly next adopted draft resolution V on "Literacy for life:
   shaping future agendas" without a vote,stressingthe importance of
   children and youth returning to school who have not yet gone back due
   to the COVID-19 pandemic. It expressed deep concern about the gender
   gap in education, as nearly two-thirds of the world's non-literate
   adults are women. The Assembly expressed further concern that one-third
   of children not attending school have disabilities and that the
   literacy rate among adults with disabilities is as low as 3 per cent in
   some countries. It urged Member States to ensure training for
   educational professionals in digital literacy and access to remote
   learning platforms to provide distance learning opportunities in
   developing countries.

   The Assembly then turned to the report on the Advancement of Women,
   which contains four draft resolutions.

   The Assembly adopted resolution I on "Intensification of efforts to
   prevent and eliminate all forms of violence against women and girls:
   gender stereotypes and negative social norms", as orally revised, by a
   vote of 170 in favour, 1 against (Iran) with 8 abstentions (Algeria,
   Belarus, Democratic People's Republic of Korea, Gabon, Libya,
   Nicaragua, Russian Federation, Syria). By its terms, the Assembly
   expressed deep concern that violence against women and girls is
   underreported, reinforcing gender inequality and corresponding
   impunity, and that historical inequalities and disregard for women's
   dignity are primary causes of marital rape and other forms of physical
   and psychological violence that reinforce the lower status of girls and
   adolescent girls in society.

   Further, the Assembly expressed alarm that violence against women and
   girls, including femicide, is among the least punished crimes due to
   gender bias in the judiciary and law enforcement. It urged States to
   strongly condemn all forms of violence against women and girls on and
   offline and reaffirmed that traditions or religious customs do not
   exempt them from its elimination. It urged States to implement
   legislation empowering women by guaranteeing full and equal access to
   education and health services.

   Adopting draft resolution II on "Trafficking in women and girls"
   without a vote, the Assembly expressed serious concern that an
   increasing number of women and girls are being trafficked to both
   developed and developing countries for sexual exploitation and organ
   removal. It also expressed concern about use of the Internet for forced
   child labour, marriage and child sexual exploitation as well as
   increasing activities of transnational criminal organizations profiting
   from human trafficking. Further, it strongly urged Governments to
   ensure coherence between laws and measures related to migration, labour
   and human trafficking to protect the human rights of migrant women and
   girls throughout migration, employment and repatriation processes.

   Next, the Assembly adopted draft resolution III on "Intensifying global
   efforts for the elimination of female genital mutilation" without a
   vote, expressing deep concern that a tremendous gap in resources
   continues to severely limit programmes on the elimination of female
   genital mutilation. It also called on States parties to focus on
   prevention strategies eliminating harmful practices that negatively
   affect women and girls, and to develop awareness-raising campaigns on
   the harmful effects of female genital mutilation.

   The Committee then adopted draft resolution IV titled "Intensification
   of efforts to end obstetric fistula" without a vote. By its terms, the
   Assembly stressed interlinkages between factors, including poverty and
   forced marriage, as root causes of obstetric fistula, and that it can
   be a cause of devastating lifelong morbidity if left untreated.It would
   express deep concern about the marginalization of women and girls,
   resulting in various forms of sexual and economic exploitation and
   abuse, which can increase the risk of obstetric fistula.

   Further, the Assembly expressed deep concern that significant
   challenges require the intensification of efforts at all levels to end
   obstetric fistula, and about the insufficient resources for addressing
   obstetric fistula in high-burden countries.It would request the
   Secretary-General to submit a comprehensive report with disaggregated
   data on obstetric fistula and challenges faced by Member States in
   implementing the present resolution to the General Assembly at its
   seventy-ninth session under the item "Advancement of women".

   The Assembly next took up the Report of the United Nations High
   Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), questions relating to refugees,
   returnees and displaced persons and humanitarian questions, which
   contains three draft resolutions.

   Adopting draft resolution I on "Enlargement of the Executive Committee
   of the Programme of the United Nations High Commissioner for
   Refugees"without a vote, it decided to increase the number of members
   of the Executive Committee of the Programme of the United Nations High
   Commissioner for Refugees from 107 to 108 States. It requested the
   Economic and Social Council to elect the additional member at a meeting
   of its management segment in 2023.

   The Assembly then adopted draft resolution II on "Office of the United
   Nations High Commissioner for Refugees" by consensus, expressing deep
   concern at the increasing number of people who are forcibly displaced,
   including from conflict, persecution and climate. It also expressed
   concern over challenges associated with hosting refugees in national
   systems, given stretched resources, and stressed the importance of
   responsibility-sharing among States. It expressed deep concern about
   increasing threats to the security of humanitarian aid workers and
   strongly condemned attacks on refugees and asylum-seekers.

   Further, the Assembly urged States to uphold the civilian and
   humanitarian character of camps and settlements for refugees and allow
   unhindered access to them for the UNHCR. It expressed grave concern at
   the large number of asylum-seekers who have lost their lives trying to
   reach safety and the unprecedented scale of the global food crisis.
   Further, the Assembly expressed grave concern over the negative
   long-term impact of continued cuts in food rations and called on donors
   to ensure sustained support for the UNHCR and World Food Programme
   (WFP).

   Also adopting draft resolution III on "Assistance to refugees,
   returnees and displaced persons in Africa" without a vote, the Assembly
   expressed grave concern about the rising number of refugees and
   displaced persons on the African continent, funding gaps in the UNHCR
   and World Health Organization (WHO) budgets and deteriorating living
   conditions in many refugee camps. It expressed further concern over the
   decreasing trend in resettlement opportunities for displaced persons.

   Also by the text, the Assembly called on the international community to
   take concrete action to meet the needs of refugees and contribute
   generously to projects and programmes to create durable solutions. It
   also condemned all acts that pose a threat to the security of refugees
   and asylum-seekers, such as refoulement or physical attacks. It called
   on UNHCR, African Union and African States to strengthen partnerships
   to support the protection system for refugees.

   Turning next to the "Report of the Human Rights Council,"and a draft
   resolution of the same name, the Assembly adopted the textby a recorded
   vote of 115 in favour to 3 against (Belarus, Israel, Nicaragua), with
   59 abstentions, taking note of the report, including the addendum
   thereto, and its recommendations.

   Speaking before the vote, the representative of Venezuela stressed the
   importance of the Human Rights Council amid global challenges,
   including reconstruction after the COVID-19 pandemic. Warning against
   politization of human rights and the negative impact of unilateral
   coercive measures on such rights, he said the Body should continue its
   work in a balanced and impartial way, in a spirit of dialogue with all
   States. He disassociated from and rejected the imposition of
   instruments and mechanisms that are established without the consent of
   Venezuela.

   The Assembly then took up the report on "Promotion and protection of
   the rights of children", which contains two draft resolutions.

   It adopted draft resolution I on "Protecting children from bullying"
   without a vote, calling on States to protect children from all forms of
   violence and provide appropriate support. It also called on States to
   invest in education and digital literacy that will ensure children's
   safety online, analyse statistical data and provide information on
   disabilities regarding bullying.

   By further terms, the Assembly called on States to adopt legislation to
   prevent bullying and strengthen the skills of professionals working
   with children in early detection and response. It urged States to
   ensure that schools address all forms of violence against children,
   particularly girls.

   The Assembly then adopted without a vote draft resolution II on "Child,
   early and forced marriage", urging States to enact laws to end such
   practices and repeal provisions that enable perpetrators of rape or
   abduction to escape prosecution by marrying their victims. It also
   called on States to ensure the timely registration of births and
   marriages and promote meaningful participation of children and
   adolescents in issues affecting them.

   By further terms, the Assembly urged Governments to tackle poverty,
   lack of economic opportunities and other drivers of child, early and
   forced marriage, including barriers to education. Further, it urged
   States to address root causes of gender inequality, drivers of violence
   and unequal power relations in which women and girls are viewed as
   subordinate.

   Next, the Assembly turned to the report on "Rights of Indigenous
   Peoples" (document A/77/460), containing one draft resolution of the
   same name.

   Acting without a vote, it adopted the draft, expressing deep concern
   that suicide rates in Indigenous Peoples' communities are often
   significantly higher than in the general population. It also stressed
   the urgent need to enhance Indigenous Peoples' adaptive capacity to
   climate change and support their efforts to address it.

   Also by the text, the Assembly urged States to ensure the safety of
   Indigenous Peoples, promoting an enabling environment, in which human
   rights violations are prevented, perpetrators held accountable and
   access to justice and remedy ensured. It also urged Governments to
   ensure that Indigenous Peoples are not forcibly removed from their
   territories and that no relocation takes place without their free,
   prior and informed consent.

   The Assembly then took up its report on "Elimination of racism, racial
   discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance", which contains two
   draft resolutions.

   Taking the floor before the action, the representative of Cuba
   expressed his country's commitment to the elimination of racism in all
   its forms. Nazism is no exception, he said. Noting and condemning the
   alarming spread of such racist ideology, he said that nothing justifies
   promoting racist or xenophobic ideas. Although the delegation has
   co-sponsored the draft for many years, it must dissociate new operative
   paragraph 3, he said, recalling the adoption of amendment L. 52, which
   he said was divisive and targeting. The text could also highlight
   neo-Nazism in the United States, he stressed.

   It then adopted draft resolution I on "Combating glorification of
   Nazism, neo-Nazism and other practices that contribute to fueling
   contemporary forms of racism, racialdiscrimination, xenophobia and
   related intolerance" as orally revised and amended, by a vote of 120 in
   favour and 50 against, with 10 abstentions (Afghanistan, Ecuador,
   Myanmar, Palau, Panama, Papau New Guinea, Samoa, Switzerland, Republic
   of Korea and T?rkiye).

   By its terms, the Assembly expressed alarm at the spread in many parts
   of the world of various extremist political parties, movements and
   ideologies, including neo-Nazis and skinhead groups. It noted with
   concern that the presence of extreme right-wing ideologues can inject
   into political discourse the same ideologies that make neo-Nazism and
   extremism so dangerous. The Assembly also expressed deep concern about
   the glorification of the Nazi movement, neo-Nazism and former members
   of the Waffen SS organization, which include erecting monuments and
   holding public demonstrations on the Nazi past.

   Further, the Assembly condemned incidents that glorify Nazism, such as
   acts involving pro-Nazi graffiti and paintings, including on monuments
   dedicated to victims of the Second World War. It expressed alarm over
   the use by extremist groups, including neo-Nazi groups, of the Internet
   and social media to recruit new members, especially targeting children
   and young people, and disseminate their hate-filled messages. The
   Assembly also condemned any denial of the Holocaust as well as
   manifestation of religious intolerance or violence based on ethnic
   origin or religious belief.

   Speaking after the adoption, the representative of Venezuela thanked
   the Russian Federation for presenting the draft on combatting Nazism,
   which he said was timely. He added that the amendment to the draft was
   hostile, undermining and politicizing the content of the amendment. His
   delegation dissociated from operative paragraph 3, but supports the
   rest of the resolution, he said.

   The representative of the Russian Federation said this generation is
   the last that will include living veterans of the Second World War. He
   said the vote was shocking, adding that, for the first time in the
   history of the United Nations, former Axis powers voted against a text
   condemning Nazism. Germany, Japan and Italy have committed blasphemy
   against victims of German Nazism, Italian Fascism and Japanese
   militarism, he stressed.

   Such fighting against members of the anti-Hitler coalition makes clear
   that discussions on hostile States are premature, he continued, asking
   the Assembly if these actions truly condemn the military operation in
   Ukraine. Saying that it does not, he decried the mentality of the
   ruling elite and noted that such delegations rewrite history. Recalling
   that the resolution is thematic and not country-specific, he rejected
   operative paragraph 4 condemning Moscow's military operation in Ukraine
   -- where Nazism is supported at a state-level, he added. Denazification
   is not a pretext, but a goal of the military operation and the Russian
   Federation will lead to its very end, he said.

   The representative of China reiterated her firm opposition to attempts
   to deny, distort and falsify the history of the Second World War; her
   firm opposition to acts of glorifying Nazism, fascism and militarism
   and acts fuelling their resurgence; and her opposition of all forms of
   racism, racialdiscrimination, xenophobia and intolerance. She said the
   practice of adding country-specific content to thematic resolutions by
   means of amendments is inconsistent with the established practice of
   the Third Committee. Among sponsors of the respective amendment, there
   are certain countries that seek to falsify the history of the Second
   World War and refuse to admit such war crimes as massive sexual
   violence, she stressed, expressing concern about the practice of a
   small number of countries creating division and politicizing relevant
   agenda items. In view of the above, she disassociated herself from the
   consensus on operative paragraph 3.

   The representative of Nicaragua reiterated her disassociation from
   operative paragraph 3, which was amended and included in draft
   resolution I.

   The representative of Belarus reiterated his country's vigorous efforts
   to preserve historic memory. He recalled that Belarus paid with the
   lives of millions of its inhabitants to eradicate Nazism. Opposing
   attempts to politicize this topic, he disassociated himself from
   operative paragraph 4, which was introduced as a politically motivated
   amendment.

   The representative of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea,
   welcoming adoption of "L.5", voiced deep concern over its amended
   contents, which have nothing to do with combatting Nazism, neo-Nazism
   and other forms of racism. It only seeks selective approaches by
   politicizing issues and targeting individual countries. Reiterating his
   country's opposition to politicization, selectivity and double
   standards, he disassociated from operative paragraph 3.

   The representative of Sri Lanka stressed that it is incumbent upon all
   Member States to give life to the letter and spirit of the Durban
   Declaration and Programme of Action in all activities. Operative
   paragraph 4 politicizes the issue of combatting racism, racial
   discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance and introduces a
   narrow, restrictive, country-specific approach. Disassociating with
   operative paragraph 4, he called on all parties to adhere to the
   principles of universality, impartiality, non-selectivity and
   objectivity in the promotion and protection of human rights.

   The representative of Ukraine reminded all that his country fought
   fascism and Nazism during the Second World War, with millions of
   Ukrainians sacrificing their lives. In response to the Russian
   Federation, he quoted the United Nations High Commissioner for Human
   Rights, who presented his report today. "Russian soldiers executed
   civilians in makeshift places of detention. Others were summarily
   executed on the spot following security checks in their houses, yards
   and doorways, even where the victim had shown clearly that they were
   not a threat, for example by holding their hands in the air. There are
   strong indicators that the summary executions by the Russians in
   Ukraine, documented in the report, may constitute the war crime of
   wilful killing." This is the fascism of today, the glorification of
   fascism and Nazism being executed by the Russian Federation and what
   the international community must stop, he stressed. Turning to
   operative paragraph 4, he noted that it does not speak about the
   special operation but rather the Russian Federation's endeavours to
   justify its military invasion and territorial aggression on the
   purported basis of eliminating neo-Nazism. "That is why we do not allow
   rapists to lecture us about how to fight rape", he emphasized.

   The representative of the Czech Republic, speaking on behalf of the
   European Union, recalled that, for many European countries, the end of
   the Second World War did not bring freedom but further occupation and
   crimes against humanity by other totalitarian regimes. Rejecting the
   term denazification, used by the Russian Federation to justify its
   illegal invasion of Ukraine, she said such distortion erodes
   understanding of the Holocaust. Reiterating her commitment to the
   global fight against racism, xenophobia and temporary forms of all
   extremist ideologies, including neo-Nazism, she noted that member
   States of the European Union will vote against the resolution.

   The representative of the United States categorically condemned the
   glorification of Nazism. Describing the resolution as an attempt to
   legitimize long-standing disinformation narratives, she stressed that
   Moscow's resolution is not a serious effort to combat Nazism and
   antisemitism; instead, it is a shameful ploy to justify its war of
   aggression in Ukraine. The United States fully supported the amendment
   that passed and became a part of the adopted resolution, she recalled,
   categorically rejecting the notion that the draft has turned into a
   country-specific resolution.

   Next, it adopted draft resolution II on "A global call for concrete
   action for the elimination of racism, racialdiscrimination, xenophobia
   and related intolerance and the comprehensive implementation of and
   followup to the Durban Declaration and Programme of Action" by a vote
   of 129 in favour, 17 against with 36 abstentions. By its terms, the
   Assembly expressed profound regret over evils inflicted on millions as
   a result of slavery, colonialism, apartheid, genocide and past
   tragedies, and called on States that have not already done so to
   dispense reparatory justice. It also requested the Secretary-General to
   include in his report on implementation of this resolution a section on
   revitalizing the trust fund for the Programme for the Decade for Action
   to Combat Racism and racialdiscrimination.

   The Assembly then took up the report on "Right of peoples to
   self-determination", which contains three draft resolutions.

   It adopted by a recorded vote of 130 in favour to 52 against, with 4
   abstentions (Mexico, Liberia, Palau, Switzerland), draft resolution I
   on "Use of mercenaries as a means of violating human rights and
   impeding the exercise of the right of peoples to self-determination".By
   its terms, the Assembly urged States to take legislative measures to
   ensure their territories and others under their control are not used
   for, and that their nationals do not take part in, the recruitment,
   financing or transit of mercenaries for activities designed to impede
   the right of peoples to self-determination, destabilize or overthrow
   Governments or impair the territorial integrity or political unity of
   sovereign States.

   Further, the Assembly requested States to exercise vigilance against
   any kind of hiring or financing of mercenaries by private companies
   offering international military consultancy and security services, and
   to impose specific bans on companies intervening in armed conflicts to
   destabilize constitutional regimes.

   The Assembly then adopted without a vote draft resolution II on
   "Universal realization of the right of peoples to self-determination",
   expressing deep concern about acts of foreign military intervention and
   occupation to suppress the right to self-determination of peoples and
   nations. It expressed grave concern that millions of people have been
   or are being uprooted from their homes as refugees and displaced
   persons due to such interventions. It called on those States
   responsible to cease their military interventions in and occupation of
   foreign countries and territories as well as the brutal methods
   employed against the populations during them.

   Next, the Assembly adopted by a recorded vote of 167 in favour to 6
   against (Chad, Israel, Marshall Islands, Federated States of
   Micronesia, Nauru, United States), with 9 abstentions (Cameroon,
   Guatemala, Kiribati, Malawi, Palau, Rwanda, Solomon Islands, Togo,
   Tuvalu), draft resolution III on "The right of the Palestinian people
   to self-determination". By the draft, it stressed the urgency of ending
   Israeli occupation of the Occupied Palestinian Territory, which began
   in 1967, as well as a just, lasting peace settlement between the
   Palestinian and Israeli sides, based on relevant resolutions of the
   United Nations and the Madrid terms of reference, including the Arab
   Peace Initiative and Quartet Road map to a permanent two-State solution
   to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. It also stressed the need to
   respect the territorial integrity of the Occupied Palestinian
   Territory, including East Jerusalem. Further, the Assembly urged all
   States and the United Nations to continue to support and assist the
   Palestinian people in the early realization of their right to
   self-determination.

   The Assembly then turned to its report on "Promotion and protection of
   human rights", which contains no draft resolutions. The Assembly took
   note of the report.

   Next, the Assembly took up its report on "Promotion and protection of
   human rights; implementation of human rights instruments", which
   contains two draft resolutions.

   It adopted without a vote draft resolution I on "Torture and other
   cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment", condemning all
   forms of torture and other cruel treatment and any attempt to legalize
   such acts, including on grounds of national security, counter-terrorism
   or through judicial decisions. It also emphasized that acts of torture
   and cruel treatment in armed conflict are serious violations of
   international humanitarian law constituting war crimes, that acts of
   torture can constitute crimes against humanity and that the
   perpetrators must be prosecuted. Further, the Assembly urged States not
   to transfer a person to another State where they would be in danger of
   being subjected to torture.

   Also by the text, the Assembly called on States to adopt measures to
   prevent torture and cruel treatment, particularly in the context of the
   use of force by law enforcement officials and in places of detention.
   It would also urge States to ensure that prolonged incommunicado
   detention and secret places of detention and interrogation are
   abolished. The Assembly also urged States to ensure that no authority
   tolerates sanctions or reprisals against any person, group or
   association seeking to contact stakeholders combating torture and
   ensure accountability for such acts.

   The Assembly then adopted draft resolution II titled "Human rights
   treaty body system", by which it would invite the Chairs of the human
   rights treaty bodies to engage in an interactive dialogue at the
   Assembly's seventy-eighth and seventy-ninth sessions. It would
   encourage all stakeholders to continue their efforts for the full
   implementation of resolution 68/268 on "Strengthening and enhancing the
   effective functioning of the human rights treaty body system". Also by
   the text, the Assembly would note that the COVID-19 pandemic showed the
   need to strengthen the capacity of the treaty bodies to interact online
   as well as the potential of digitalization for improved efficiency of
   such bodies and the interaction with stakeholders.

   Next, the Assembly took up the report on "Human rights questions,
   including alternative approaches for improving the effective enjoyment
   of human rights and fundamental freedoms", which contains 15 draft
   resolutions.

   Speaking in explanation of position before the vote, the representative
   of Maldives said that while the death penalty is a form of punishment
   that can be prescribed under the laws of his country, Maldives has
   maintained an informal moratorium on that. His Government will take
   substantial steps to implement positive and meaningful changes to its
   judiciary and to align domestic legal instruments with international
   obligations. While the death penalty remains on the books, the
   government understands that the country's criminal justice system must
   be reformed, he said.

   The representative of Oman speaking on behalf of the Gulf Cooperation
   Council, stressed that it is important to respect the sovereignty of
   countries as stipulated in the Charter. The death penalty is part of
   many national legislations and of the sovereign practices of the
   countries in her group. Also highlighting operative paragraph one as a
   cornerstone for entering into any discussions about the death penalty,
   she added that all countries have the right to implement their own
   domestic laws to ensure their security.

   It then adopted without a vote draft resolution I on "The right to
   privacy in the digital age", calling on States to protect the right to
   privacy, including in the context of digital communications and new and
   emerging technologies. It also called on States to regularly review
   their procedures regarding the surveillance of communications, the use
   of profiling, automated decision-making, machine learning and biometric
   technologies. The Assembly further called on States to develop policies
   to ensure that all business enterprises respect the right to privacy in
   the design of technologies.

   The Assembly then adopted by a recorded vote of 132 in favour and 25
   against, with 28 abstentions, draft resolution II on "The right to
   development",stressing the need to increase the participation of
   developing countries in international decision-making. It also
   expressed concern about increasing cases of human rights abuses by
   transnational corporations, underlined the need to ensure justice and
   underscored that these entities must contribute to the right to
   development.

   Also by the text, the Assembly expressed deep concern about the
   negative impact that the aggravated economic and social situation has
   on the right to development, particularly in developing countries. It
   urged developed countries to meet the targets of 0.7 per cent of their
   gross national product (GNP) for official development assistance (ODA)
   to developing countries and 0.15 to 0.2 per cent of their GNP to the
   least developed countries. Further, it emphasized the urgent need to
   take measures to combat corruption at all levels.

   Without a vote, the Assembly then adopted draft resolution III on
   "Enhancement of international cooperation in the field of human
   rights".By the text, it urged all international actors to reject all
   doctrines of exclusion based on racism, racialdiscrimination,
   xenophobia and related intolerance. It emphasized the importance of the
   Universal Periodic Review as a mechanism based on cooperation, and the
   need for a constructive approach by all stakeholders to resolve human
   rights issues in international forums. Further, the Assembly urged
   States to take measures necessary to enhance bilateral, regional and
   international cooperation to address the adverse impact of compounded
   global crises on human rights.

   Next, the Assembly took up draft resolution IV on "Human rights and
   unilateral coercive measures" by a recorded vote of 130 in favour and
   53 against, with 1 abstention (Brazil). By the text, it expressed deep
   concern about States facing both unilateral coercive measures and the
   impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. It urged States to cease adopting
   unilateral measures counter to international law and refrain from
   applying unilateral trade measures that impede sustainable economic
   development. Further, the Assembly condemned including Member States in
   unilateral lists under false pretexts, such as terrorism sponsorship,
   and strongly objected to the extraterritorial nature of measures
   threatening the sovereignty of States.

   Also by the text, the Assembly requested the Secretary-General and
   United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights to provide necessary
   resources for the Special Rapporteur's mandate, and that the Rapporteur
   submit a report on implementation of the present resolution and the
   negative impact of unilateral coercive measures to the General Assembly
   at its seventy-eighth session.

   By a recorded vote of 122 in favour and 54 against, with 10 abstentions
   (Armenia, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Liberia, Mexico, Panama,
   Peru, Uruguay), the Assembly then adopted draft resolution V on
   "Promotion of a democratic and equitable international order". By its
   terms, it expressed deep concern that the current global economic,
   climate and food crises widen the gap between developed and developing
   countries. It also expressed deep concern about uneven access to
   COVID-19 vaccines for developing countries, emphasizing that an
   equitable approach enhances the capacities of all countries to have
   equal access to vaccines. It urged all actors to build an order based
   on inclusion, solidarity, mutual universal human rights and to reject
   all doctrines of exclusion based on racism, xenophobia and related
   intolerance.

   Next, the Assembly adopted draft resolution VI on "Promotion of peace
   as a vital requirement for the full enjoyment of all human rights by
   all" by a recorded vote of 131 in favour and 53 against, with 1
   abstention (Brazil), stressing that the deep fault line dividing human
   society into rich and poor and ever-increasing gap between the
   developed and developing worlds pose a major threat to global
   prosperity, peace and security and stability. It also emphasized that
   promotion of peace demands that policies of States be directed towards
   elimination of the threat of war, particularly nuclear war,
   renunciation of the use or threat of use of force in international
   relations and settlement of international disputes by peaceful means.

   Adopting draft resolution VII on "The right to food" without a vote,
   the Assembly expressed deep concern that over 2.3 billion people in the
   world experience moderate or severe food insecurity. Further, it
   expressed alarm that, in 2021, the number of people who had no access
   to adequate food rose to 3.1 billion, and that between 702 million and
   828 million people faced hunger.

   Also by the text, the Assembly expressed deep concern that, while women
   contribute over 50 per cent of the food produced worldwide, they
   represent 70 per cent of the world's hungry. It called on States to
   take measures to combat undernutrition in mothers and children and
   eliminate preventable mortality and morbidity of children under 5.
   Further, it called on States to combat the causes of hunger among
   Indigenous Peoples.

   Next, the Assembly adopted by a recorded vote of 133 in favour and,
   none against, with 44 abstentions, draft resolution VIII on
   "Extrajudicial, Summary or Arbitrary Executions," noting with deep
   concern that impunity can perpetuate extrajudicial, summary or
   arbitrary executions and femicide and that such executions are
   committed against persons exercising their rights, including to
   peaceful assembly and freedom of expression. Further, it urged States
   to take necessary measures to ensure the safety and security of
   national and international humanitarian personnel. The Assembly also
   requested the Secretary-General to offer appropriate resources to
   Special Rapporteurs to carry out their mandates, including through
   country visits.

   Without a vote, the Assembly then adopted draft resolution IX on "Human
   Rights in the Administration of Justice", urging States to ensure the
   meaningful participation of women at all levels and equal access to
   justice. It also urged States to reduce pretrial detention and
   eliminate discrimination in law and practice against persons who are in
   vulnerable situations or marginalized. In addition, it urged States to
   ensure that neither capital punishment nor life imprisonment without
   the possibility of release nor corporal punishment is imposed for
   offences committed by persons under 18 years of age. Further, it called
   on States to ensure effective access to justice for persons with
   disabilities.

   Following that, without a vote, the Assembly adopted draft resolution X
   on "Missing persons", calling on States parties to armed conflict to
   prevent persons from going missing, account for persons reported
   missing and ensure investigations and accountability. It also urged
   States to avoid harming civilians who prevent persons from going
   missing in armed conflict, including by minimizing military use of
   civilian infrastructure. Further, it called on States to determine the
   fate of the missing and provide family members with all information.

   The Assembly then adopted without a vote draft resolution XI on
   "Freedom of religion or belief", expressing serious concern over acts
   of violence based on religion and the increasing number and intensity
   of such incidents. Further, it expressed concern that State and
   non-State actors encourage violence against religious minorities as
   well as by an increasing number of laws that limit the freedom of
   thought, religion or belief.

   Also by the text, the Assembly expressed serious concern about attacks
   on religious sites and shrines, including those carried out in
   connection with incitement to national, racial or religious hatred. It
   strongly condemned any advocacy of hatred based on religion in any form
   of media.

   Next, by a recorded vote of 125 in favour to 37 against, with 22
   abstentions, the Assembly adopted draft resolution XII on "Moratorium
   on the use of the death penalty", as amended, expressing deep concern
   about continued application of the death penalty. It called on States
   to make available information on their use of the death penalty and any
   scheduled executions, ensuring that trials leading to its imposition
   comply with internationally recognized fair-trial guarantees. Further,
   the Assembly called on States to progressively restrict use of the
   death penalty and ensure that those facing it can exercise their right
   to apply for pardon or commutation.

   The Assembly also called on States to ensure that inmates, their
   children, families and legal representatives are provided with adequate
   information about their detention and pending execution to allow a last
   visit or communication, the return of the body for burial or
   information about where the body is located. In addition, it called on
   States to ensure the death penalty is not applied based on
   discriminatory laws, improve conditions in detention and establish a
   moratorium on executions with a view to abolishing the death penalty.

   The Assembly then adopted draft resolution XIII on "Human rights and
   extreme poverty"without a vote, expressing concern that the total
   number of persons living in extreme poverty remains unacceptably high
   as well as over non-income dimensions of poverty, such as access to
   equitable quality education or basic health services. It also expressed
   concern over the increase of people living in poverty due to food,
   economic and climate crises and their negative effect on the capacity
   of States to fight extreme poverty. Further, the Assembly called on
   Member States to remove obstacles that people in poverty face in areas
   such as housing, employment, education, health and other social
   services, as well as legal frameworks that discriminate based on
   socioeconomic status.

   The Assembly then adopted without a vote resolution XIV on "The role of
   Ombudsman and mediator institutions in the promotion and protection of
   human rights, good governance and the rule of law".By its terms, the
   Assembly would note with serious concern that Ombudsman and mediator
   institutions experience threats to their autonomy or security. It would
   stress the importance of the financial and administrative independence
   of these institutions, and that they play an important role in advising
   Governments' national policies, bringing them in line with their
   international human rights obligations. The Assembly would also request
   the Secretary-General to report on the implementation of the present
   resolution to the General Assembly at its seventy-eighth session and to
   the Human Rights Council at its fifty-fourth session.

   Following that, the Assembly adopted draft resolution XV on "Combating
   intolerance, negative stereotyping, stigmatization, discrimination,
   incitement to violence and violence against persons, based on religion
   or belief" without a vote. By the text, it condemned criminal acts
   committed by extremist groups against persons based on their religion
   or belief, expressing deep concern about the prevalence of impunity by
   perpetrators. It also expressed deep concern at continued instances of
   derogatory stereotyping and stigmatization of persons based on their
   religion or belief, as well as agendas pursued by extremist individuals
   and organizations perpetuating negative stereotypes about religious
   groups. Further, it condemned any advocacy of religious hatred inciting
   hostility or violence in the media and called on States to adopt
   policies to protect places of worship, cemeteries and shrines if they
   are vulnerable to vandalism or destruction.

   The representative for Saint Kitts and Nevis, explaining her country's
   vote against draft resolution XII, underscored the significance of a
   comprehensive and just criminal system. Her Government applies the
   death penalty only as a punishment for the most heinous crimes after
   extensive due process, ensures its national laws are in line with
   international law provisions and firmly believes that application of
   the death penalty is a criminal justice issue within its justification.
   Situations of abuse, she reminded, may be treated as a human rights
   issue in relevant and already established tribunals instead of being
   politicized in the Third Committee. Although her country engaged in
   hopes of clarifying and correcting inaccurate and misleading
   assertions, it nevertheless is concerned by problematic content that
   remains. She voiced hope that there will be greater flexibility in the
   future in addressing such issues.

   The representative for Singapore, explaining his country's vote against
   the same draft, stressed that the resolution is inconsistent with
   international law by not acknowledging article VI of the International
   Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and omits the rights of victims
   and families. Further, it seeks to export a particular model of society
   to the rest of the world, undertakes a "one-size-fits-all" approach and
   does not acknowledge or respect the diversity of legal systems
   worldwide. Voicing his deep disappointment with the resolution's
   proponents, especially over their arbitrary deletion of an operative
   paragraph on States' sovereignty, he called on them to reflect
   carefully on their approach, abandon their attitude of "arrogance and
   cultural superiority", show respect for the principle of sovereignty
   and listen carefully to the diversity of positions on this issue. "The
   ball is in their court," he said, expressing hope that they will change
   their approach.

   The representative for the Philippines disassociated from all
   references to the International Criminal Court under agenda item 68.
   Her Government, she noted, withdrew from the Rome Statute in 2019 out
   of its principled stand against those who politicize human rights and
   disregard the Philippines' independent and well-functioning organs and
   agencies. Notwithstanding this withdrawal, she reaffirmed her country's
   commitment to the promotion and protection of human rights as well as
   the fight against impunity for atrocity crimes.

   The Assembly then took up its report on "Human rights situations and
   reports of special rapporteurs and representatives: report of the
   Committee", which contains five draft resolutions.

   The representative of the Russian Federation, speaking in explanation
   of vote before the vote, stressed that country resolutions have little
   to do with the overall situation in nations concerned. Instead, their
   goal is to further political agendas and wage political wars. They are
   characterized by unfounded accusations, lies and empty appeals, he
   said, adding that the content of these documents is becoming
   increasingly divorced from reality. Moreover, they discredit the United
   Nations human rights system based on the principle of equality of
   States. Regarding the draft on "Situation of human rights in the
   temporarily occupied Autonomous Republic of Crimea and the city of
   Sevastopol, Ukraine", he condemned Kyiv's hate-based policy towards its
   Russian-speaking population as well as its egregious human rights
   violations, including torture, killings and cultivation of neo-Nazism.
   A vote in favour would mean supporting military escalation, he
   asserted, noting that his delegation will vote against the escalation
   of the crisis and against the impunity of the Kyiv regime.

   The representative of Iran categorically rejected the draft resolution
   concerning her country, supported by those with the darkest human
   rights records. She criticized attempts to marginalize Iran through
   exploitation of United Nations mechanisms and deny Iranian women the
   opportunity to collaborate in the Commission on the Status of Women.
   This resolution does not concern the protection of human rights;
   instead, it aims to exert political pressure on Iran. The core value of
   multilateralism is violated to reach unilateralist aims, she cautioned,
   condemning the imposition of illegal unilateral coercive measures
   against independent countries like Iran. Canada cannot play the role of
   a saint regarding human rights, she said, also adding that the Israeli
   regime continues the practice of forced evictions, arbitrary detentions
   and torture. She called on States to adhere to the universal principles
   of objectivity, impartiality and non-selectivity.

   The representative of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea
   condemned in the strongest terms the draft on the human rights
   situation in his country. He described the draft as a political
   provocation aimed at undermining the political system in the Democratic
   People's Republic of Korea that has nothing to do with genuine
   protection of human rights. The United States and Western countries are
   abusing human rights issues as a political tool for overthrowing
   systems of other countries. He reiterated his country's principled
   position against politization of human rights.

   Without a vote, the Assembly then adopted draft resolution I on
   "Situation of human rights in the Democratic People's Republic of
   Korea". By its terms, it expressed deep concern at the pervasive
   culture of impunity and lack of accountability for human rights
   violations and abuses in that country. It expressed serious concern
   about continuing reports of such abuses, including torture; sexual and
   gender-based violence; extrajudicial, summary and arbitrary executions;
   imposition of the death penalty for political and religious reasons;
   extrajudicial and arbitrary detention; and absence of due process and
   rule of law. The Assembly further expressed strong concern about
   political prison camps; enforced and involuntary disappearances of
   persons by arrest; and pervasive restrictions on freedoms of thought,
   religion, expression, peaceful assembly and the right to privacy.

   Also, by the text, the Assembly expressed deep concern about the
   prevalence of chronic and acute malnutrition among persons in the most
   vulnerable situations, exacerbated by a lack of access to basic
   services, including health care, clean water and sanitation. It
   strongly urged the Government of the Democratic People's Republic of
   Korea to immediately put an end to systematic and widespread violations
   of human rights; close political prison camps and release all political
   prisoners; and ensure that everyone within the territory enjoys the
   right to freedom of movement and is free to leave the country.

   Next, the Assembly adopted without a vote draft resolution II on
   "Situation of human rights of Rohingya Muslims and other minorities in
   Myanmar" , by which it condemned in the strongest terms all violations
   of human rights against civilians, including Rohingya Muslims and other
   minorities in Myanmar, perpetrated by security and armed forces, which
   amount to the gravest crimes under international law. It reiterated
   deep concern at continuing forced displacement of civilians;
   recruitment of children; abductions; arbitrary detentions; killings and
   maiming; and attacks on schools, hospitals, places of worship and large
   civilian gatherings. The Assembly further expressed deep concern over
   the use of hospitals and schools for military purposes as well as
   landmines, making conditions in Rakhine State unsuitable for the
   voluntary and safe return of refugees and forcibly displaced persons,
   including the Rohingya.

   Also by the text, the Assembly expressed deep concern that, in Rakhine,
   more than 600,000 Rohingya Muslims remain largely segregated and
   discriminated against in accessing citizenship and other fundamental
   rights, many of whom remain confined in camps with no freedom of
   movement. It also expressed alarm at continued attacks on medical and
   humanitarian actors and the lack of safe and unhindered humanitarian
   access. Further, the Assembly urgently called on Myanmar or the Myanmar
   Military to end immediately all violations of international law; ensure
   protection of human rights of all persons in Myanmar; and ensure full
   accountability and end impunity, starting with independent
   investigations. The Assembly requested the Secretary-General to extend
   the appointment of the Special Envoy on Myanmar and enable the Envoy on
   to discharge her mandate.

   The Assembly then adopted draft resolution III on "Situation of human
   rights in the Islamic Republic of Iran" by a recorded vote of 80 in
   favour and 29 against, with 65 abstentions. It expressed serious
   concern at the significant increase in use of the death penalty in
   Iran; disproportionate application of the death penalty to persons
   belonging to minorities; and continuing disregard for protections under
   Iranian law or internationally recognized safeguards relating to the
   death penalty. It strongly urged Iran to eliminate all forms of
   systemic discrimination and other human rights violations against women
   and girls; ensure women's and girls' equal protection and access to
   justice, including by prohibiting so-called honour killings and child,
   early and forced marriage; lift restrictions on women's and girls'
   equal access to primary and secondary education; and remove legal and
   cultural barriers to women's equal participation in the labour market
   and all aspects of economic, cultural and political life.

   The Assembly also expressed serious concern that the enforcement of the
   hijab and chastity law and its violent implementation by the Iranian
   morality police fundamentally undermines the human rights of women and
   girls. It strongly urged Iran to cease the use of excessive force
   against peaceful protestors, such as in the aftermath of Mahsa Amini's
   arbitrary arrest and subsequent death while in custody. Further, it
   called on Iran to eliminate all forms of discrimination based on
   thought, religion or belief, reiterating the importance of independent
   investigations for all allegations of human rights violations,
   including excessive use of force, arbitrary arrest, detention and
   torture. The Assembly also called on Iran to cooperate fully with the
   Special Rapporteur on human rights in Iran, including by accepting
   repeated requests to visit the country.

   By a recorded vote of 82 in favour and 14 against, with 80 abstentions,
   the Assembly then adopted resolution IV on "Situation of human rights
   in the temporarily occupied Autonomous Republic of Crimea and the city
   of Sevastopol, Ukraine". By the text, it condemned the ongoing
   temporary occupation of Crimea by the Russian Federation as well as its
   unprovoked aggression against Ukraine. It also condemned the imposition
   and retroactive application of the Russian Federation's legal system;
   imposition of its automatic citizenship on protected persons in Crimea;
   and deportation, and effective restriction of land ownership of those
   who have rejected that citizenship.

   Further, the Assembly expressed deep concern about continued reports
   that the law enforcement system of the Russian Federation conducts
   searches and raids of private homes and businesses in Crimea, which
   disproportionally affect Crimean Tatars. It also condemned reported
   violations of international humanitarian law and human rights,
   including extrajudicial killings, abductions, enforced disappearances,
   politically motivated prosecutions, discrimination and violence. It
   expressed deep concern about restrictions faced by Ukrainians, in
   particular Crimean Tatars, in exercising their rights to work, the
   ability to maintain their identity and culture and the right to
   education in Ukrainian and Crimean Tatar languages.

   In this context, the Assembly demanded that the Russian Federation
   immediately end all violations of human rights and international
   humanitarian law against residents of the temporarily occupied Crimea;
   arbitrary detentions and arrests; enforced disappearances; torture and
   other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment; sexual and gender-based
   violence; and compelling apprehended persons to self-incriminate or
   "cooperate" with law enforcement. It also demanded that the Russian
   Federation ensure fair trial, revoke all discriminatory legislation and
   hold accountable those responsible for violations by ensuring
   independent investigations.

   Next, the Assembly adopted resolution V on "Situation of human rights
   in the Syrian Arab Republic" by a vote of 92 in favour and 14 against,
   with 71 abstentions. By the text, it strongly condemned the
   indiscriminate killing of civilians and continued indiscriminate use of
   heavy weapons and aerial bombardments, which have caused more than
   500,000 fatalities, including the killing of more than 29,000 children;
   starvation of civilians as a method of warfare; and use of chemical
   weapons. It noted with grave concern that the Office of the UNHCR has
   identified 306,887 civilians who were killed in the conflict in Syria
   between March 2011 and March 2022, including 26,727 women and 27,126
   children.

   Further, the Assembly expressed grave concern at the remaining presence
   of violent extremism and terrorist groups in Syria, expressing alarm
   that more than 5.6 million refugees have been forced to flee the
   country, and that 11.1 million people, of whom 6.6 million are
   internally displaced, require urgent humanitarian assistance, which has
   resulted in an influx of Syrian refugees into neighbouring countries,
   other countries in the region and beyond. It demanded that the Syrian
   regime and ISIL/Da'esh immediately desist from any further use of
   chemical weapons. The Assembly further called for the continuation of
   cross-border humanitarian support beyond January 2023 and for at least
   12 months. The Assembly also demanded that the Syrian regime cooperate
   fully with the Commission of Inquiry, including by granting it
   immediate and unhindered access throughout the country.

   Speaking in explanation of position after adoption, the representative
   of Ukraine pointed to forcible deportations, illegal detention,
   tortures, executions and other massive crimes against humanity
   committed by the Russian Federation. Thousands of Ukrainian prisoners
   of war and civilians remain in terrible conditions in detention in the
   temporarily occupied territories, he said, adding that hundreds of
   orphans were given for adoption to Russian families. The resolution
   just adopted notes that the temporary occupation of Crimea became a
   blueprint for a grave human rights crisis in other territories of
   Ukraine, he pointed out.

   The representative of China opposed provoking countries and the
   practice of pressuring them under the pretext of human rights.
   Rejecting establishment of country-specific mechanisms without the
   concerned country's consent, she said her delegation voted against the
   three drafts that were voted on. Concerning the drafts on the
   Democratic People's Republic of Korea and Myanmar, China will not join
   consensus, she said.

   The representative of Saint Kits and Nevis said resolutions under this
   item run counter to principles of double-standards and non-selectivity,
   suggesting that the Universal Periodic Review is the correct tool to
   review human rights issues in countries. Although the country abstained
   from the vote, Saint Kits and Nevis supports the substance of the
   draft, she said, calling on all countries to protect human rights.

   The representative of Cuba said he does not support politically
   motivated resolutions without consent from concerned countries.
   Dissociating from the resolution on the Democratic People's Republic of
   Korea, he added that such texts foster mistrust in general, but that
   this one takes the dangerous step of involving the Security Council,
   which oversteps this Committee's mandate. Cuba will not be complicit in
   attacks against the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and their
   rights to self-determination and development, he said. Adding that only
   international cooperation and adherence to principles of
   non-selectivity will allow the international community to progress on
   human rights, he said his delegation favours the Universal Periodic
   Review.

   The representative of Nicaragua reiterated rejection of the respective
   resolutions, based on politicized selectivity, lack of objectivity and
   absence of consent of the country concerned. He disassociated himself
   from the resolution on the human rights situation in the Democratic
   People's Republic of Korea, reiterating his commitment to promotion and
   protection of all human rights, opposing politicization of the matter.

   The representative of Belarus reiterated his country's consistent
   opposition of selective examination of country-specific human rights
   topics. Instrumentalization of human rights through country resolutions
   does not resolve human rights problems, but rather exacerbates
   confrontation between Member States, he stressed. Based on this
   approach, Belarus voted against all country resolutions and
   disassociated itself from consensus on the resolutions on situations in
   the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and Myanmar.

   The representative of Syria rejected politicization and selectivity in
   addressing human rights issues. She also opposed antagonization,
   confrontation and attempts to isolate countries -- in double standards
   -- aimed at covering crimes of other States and their violation of
   human rights. The fact that such resolutions are being adopted creates
   arenas for confrontation. She stressed that the adoption of
   country-specific resolutions politicizes promotion of human rights and
   constitutes a violation of the principles of objectivity and
   non-selectivity. She, thus, dissociated herself from consensus on the
   resolution relating to the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and
   reaffirmed voting against the three that were voted on. She pointed out
   that Syria will acknowledge and accept the mandate emanating from such
   resolutions when there will be 193 similar resolutions. "What applies
   to others, will apply to us. What applies to us, must also apply to
   others," she stressed.

   The representative of Venezuela reiterated his country's rejection of
   any report or resolution against a specific country without that
   Government's consent, since they are expressions of politicization and
   selectivity. Since these mechanisms do not enter into a dialogue with
   all parties and are often submitted to third and even fourth parties,
   they lack objectivity, impartiality, transparency, non-selectivity,
   non-politicization, non-confrontation and equality and mutual respect
   for national sovereignty. He then disassociated from the resolution on
   the human rights situation in the Democratic People's Republic of
   Korea.

   The Assembly then turned to its report, "Promotion and protection of
   human rights: comprehensive implementation of and follow-up to the
   Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action", which contains no draft
   proposals. The Assembly took note of the report.

   The Assembly then took up the report, Crime Prevention and Criminal
   Justice, which contains seven resolutions, all adopted without a vote.

   It adopted draft resolution I on "Follow-up to the fourteenth United
   Nations Congress on Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice and
   preparations for the fifteenth United Nations Congress on Crime
   Prevention and Criminal Justice", whichcontains programme budget
   implications. By its terms, the Assembly requested the Commission on
   Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice to continue implementing the
   appropriate policy for follow-up to the Kyoto Declaration and decided
   to hold the fifteenth United Nations Congress on Crime Prevention and
   Criminal Justice in 2026. The Assembly further requested the Commission
   on Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice to approve at its
   thirty-second session the overall theme and agenda items for the
   workshops of the fifteenth Congress.

   Adopting draft resolution II, "Reducing reoffending through
   rehabilitation and reintegration", the Assembly requested the United
   Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) to convene a meeting of an
   open-ended intergovernmental expert group to develop model strategies
   on reducing reoffending that can serve as useful tools for Member
   States. It requested UNODC to support efforts of Member States to
   reduce reoffending through promotion of rehabilitative environments by
   providing technical assistance to Member States, in particular
   developing countries.

   Next, the Assembly adopted draft resolution III on "Strengthening
   national and international efforts, including with the private sector,
   to protect children from sexual exploitation and abuse". It noted with
   concern the growing threat posed by "self-generated" child sexual abuse
   materials, where children are coerced into producing such materials, as
   well as linkages between child sexual exploitation and trafficking in
   children for commercial sexual exploitation. It further urged Member
   States to criminalize all forms of child sexual exploitation and abuse,
   including online, grant law enforcement agencies authority and provide
   tools to identify victims and bring perpetrators to justice.

   Adopting draft resolution IV on "United Nations African Institute for
   the Prevention of Crime and the Treatment of Offenders", the Assembly
   urged the Institute's member States to pay all or part of their
   outstanding arrears. It further urged Member States, non-governmental
   organizations and the international community to continue to adopt
   measures to support the Institute in developing requisite capacity and
   implementing its activities aimed at strengthening criminal justice
   systems in Africa.

   The Assembly then took up draft resolution V on "Preventing and
   combating corrupt practices and the transfer of proceeds of corruption,
   facilitating asset recovery and returning such assets to legitimate
   owners, in particular to countries of origin, in accordance with the
   United Nations Convention against Corruption". By the text, the
   Assembly expressed concern that corruption threatens the stability of
   societies and that the impact of widespread corruption
   disproportionately affects the most disadvantaged. It stressed that
   preventive measures are the most effective means of avoiding corruption
   and, calling on States parties to the Convention to fulfil their
   commitments, such as criminalizing the bribing of foreign public
   officials and preventing the acquisition, transfer and laundering of
   proceeds of corruption.

   Also by the text, the Assembly urged States parties to designate a
   central authority for international cooperation and remove barriers to
   asset recovery. It also urged States to develop effective
   anti-corruption policies promoting society's participation and called
   on the private sector to remain engaged in the fight against
   corruption. The Assembly requested the Secretary-General to continue
   providing UNODC resources to promote implementation of the Convention
   and fund the accompanying review mechanism.

   Next, the Assembly adopted draft resolution VI on "Strengthening and
   promoting effective measures and international cooperation on organ
   donation and transplantation to prevent and combat trafficking in
   persons for the purpose of organ removal and trafficking in human
   organs". It thereby urged States to strengthen legislative frameworks
   to combat trafficking in persons for the purpose of organ removal and
   trafficking in human organs, including the criminalization of these
   practices to ensure accountability. It also urged them to guarantee
   that donation of organs is guided by clinical criteria and ethical
   norms and that the removal and transplantation of human organs take
   place in specifically authorized centres. It further urged the
   development of regulatory oversight of medical facilities and
   professionals and of registries regarding each organ recovery and
   transplantation procedure and outcomes for living donors and
   recipients, as well as identification systems.

   The Assembly then adopted draft resolution VII on "Strengthening the
   United Nations crime prevention and criminal justice programme, in
   particular its technical cooperation capacity",urging States to develop
   strategies to effectively address transnational organized crime and
   strengthen cooperation in accordance with the United Nations Convention
   against Corruption for asset recovery, with the cooperation of the
   UNODC. It also called on States to strengthen cooperation to counter
   foreign terrorist fighters, and address radicalization to terrorism in
   prisons.

   Also by the text, the Assembly urged States parties to make use of the
   United Nations Convention against Transnational Organized Crime for
   cooperation in combating trafficking of cultural property, especially
   in returning such confiscated proceeds to their legitimate owners. It
   also urged States to introduce national and international measures to
   combat illicit trafficking of cultural property and take steps at the
   national level to eradicate the illegal trade of wildlife.

   The Assembly then turned to its report "Countering the use of
   information and communications technologies for criminal purposes",
   which contains no draft proposals. The Assembly took note of the
   report.

   The Assembly then turned to the report "International drug control",
   which contains one draft resolution.

   It adopted the draft on "Addressing the world drug problem through a
   comprehensive and balanced approach" by a recorded vote of 124 in
   favour to 9 against (Belarus, Cameroon, Iran, Nicaragua, Niger,
   Pakistan, Russian Federation, Syria and T?rkiye), with 45 abstentions.
   By its terms, the Assembly condemned discriminatory or violent
   practices by law enforcement officials against marginalized persons,
   including systemic racism in law enforcement and criminal justice
   systems. It also expressed deep concern that drug traffickers are
   heavily armed with firearms obtained through trafficking, and expressed
   concern that illicit cultivation of drug crops can cause serious harm
   to the environment, deforestation and groundwater contamination.
   Further, the Assembly urged Member States and other donors to continue
   to fund the global drug problem response to address the growing
   HIV/AIDS epidemic among people who inject drugs, and in prisons.

   Speaking in explanation of vote, the representative of the Russian
   Federation noted that the old text of the consensus omnibus resolution
   of 2021 was supported by all, as it reflected the outcome of many years
   of negotiations to harmonize positions of delegations in New York. He
   thanked those who voted against or abstained, adding that the
   resolution is imbalanced and unacceptable.

   The Assembly next took up the report on "Revitalization of the Work of
   the General Assembly", which contains one draft resolution.

   It adopted the draft resolution on "Draft programme of work of the
   Third Committee for the seventy-eighth session of the General Assembly"
   without a vote.

   The Assembly then turned to its report "Programme planning", which
   contains no draft proposals. The Assembly took note of the report.

Paul F. deLespinasse: Are we combating discrimination the wrong way?
     __________________________________________________________________

   Paul F. deLespinasse  |  The Daily Telegram

   racialdiscrimination is a major problem. But the approach we have
   taken to fix this problem is itself problematical.

   Slavery and segregation were created by legislation enforced by
   rigorous government sanctions. Legal reforms were obviously needed, and
   the first step was to eliminate this legislation.

   In his 1963 "Letter From A Birmingham Jail," Martin Luther King
   proclaimed that "An unjust law is a code that a majority inflicts on a
   minority that is not binding on itself. This is difference made
   legal."

   King was right, because genuine laws must be general rules of action,
   and rules applying only to people of one race are not general. A
   general rule must apply to anybody taking the prohibited action.

   A rule requiring only people of color to ride in the back of the bus is
   clearly not a general one. (And it would make no sense at all to
   require everybody to ride in the back of the bus. No matter to whom it
   is applied, this kind of rule is just plain crazy!)

   I differ from Dr. King only in that I don't concede that the unjust
   codes he referred to rise to the dignity of law at all. They are
   pseudolaws, not just bad laws.

   The pseudolaws supporting slavery and mandating racial segregation have
   been repealed or declared unconstitutional. But lingering social
   attitudes, institutional inertia and continued suffering of descendants
   of the former slaves called for further major reforms.

   Laws whose goal was to reduce or eliminate racialdiscrimination were
   an obvious and legitimate next step.

   A genuine civil rights law whose goal is to combat racial
   discrimination could have been a requirement that stores and other
   public facilities accept all would be customers first come, first
   served.

   The vital parts of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 dealing with open
   accommodations (in stores, restaurants, hotels, etc.) would have been
   even more effective if they had been, instead, first come, first served
   rules.

   But rather than imposing a first come, first served rule, civil rights
   legislation has tried to make make "discrimination" itself illegal. The
   problem is that discrimination is not an action. It can be a reason or
   motivation for an action, but it is not itself an action. And as I
   indicated already, law must be a rule of action.

   Under current legislation, the act of declining to hire a person of
   color is not illegal unless the reason for that decision is that the
   applicant is a person of color.

   The very same action in identical circumstances can thus be either
   legal or legal, depending on whether a judge, jury or bureaucrat thinks
   that the motive for the action was illegal. Since motives cannot be
   observed but must be inferred, or assumed, this gives officials
   tremendous discretionary power.

   By contrast, although the motive for violating a first come, first
   served rule would be legally irrelevant, such laws would prevent
   establishments from engaging in racialdiscrimination. Since
   discrimination is not an action, efforts to make it illegal are
   pseudolaws.

   Paradoxically, our efforts to eliminate racialdiscrimination have
   employed the same kind of illegitimate tools that created slavery and
   racial segregation.

   Formerly, individuals and organizations wishing to enter into voluntary
   associations with people of another race were "legally" prevented from
   doing so. This is what segregation did.

   We now try to force people of different races to enter into
   associations with each other whether they prefer to do so or not. These
   associations are hardly voluntary ones, since voluntary associations
   can only be created by mutual consent to associate.

   We should try a third approach: respecting freedom of voluntary
   association except when limits on this freedom are imposed by genuine
   laws.

State civil rights department files more racialdiscrimination charges
against Grand Rapids police

   The Michigan Department of Civil Rights has filed more charges of
   racialdiscrimination against the Grand Rapids Police Department.

   The charges announced Thursday are over [191]an incident that happened
   in the city in 2018, when GRPD stopped a group of three Black boys and
   held them at gunpoint, based on a call that the boys had a toy gun.

   "There was no initial crime reported," said MDCR director John E.
   Johnson Jr. "There's nothing illegal about two children walking near
   train tracks with what the 911 caller identified repeatedly as a toy
   gun."

   Johnson said GRPD couldn't provide any evidence of white children ever
   receiving the same treatment. The formal civil rights charges against
   the department only involve the treatment of the two 11-year-old boys
   stopped during the incident. The MDCR says it didn't receive a
   complaint about the 17-year-old who was stopped with them.

   The MDCR says it currently has 21 open investigations of alleged civil
   rights abuses by the GRPD -- more than twice as many open civil rights
   investigations as any other police department in the state. The next
   highest number is for Detroit police, with eight open investigations
   against it, then Lansing, with six, according to a civil rights
   department spokesperson.

   The spokesperson said the department currently has a total of 119 open
   civil rights investigations involving police departments in Michigan.

   The number of open investigations of alleged abuses involving GRPD
   includes [192]two cases that led to formal charges filed this summer.

   All of the formal charges announced by the MDCR are submitted to an
   administrative law judge, who decides whether to issue fines against
   the police department, and possibly force the department to take steps
   to correct its practices.

   "We are aware of today's announcement by the MDCR," said a city
   spokesperson in response to a request for comment from Michigan Radio.
   "We have not yet been served with the charges. We'll be reviewing the
   charges and responding appropriately."

   Residents in Grand Rapids have complained for years about how the Grand
   Rapids police department treats its non-white residents. A [193]2017
   report commissioned by the city showed that Black drivers were twice as
   likely to be stopped as white drivers. And there have been [194]a
   series of high profile incidents involving how GRPD treats children
   during stops. Two of those incidents are now part of the formal charges
   against the department.

   The civil rights department held two public listening sessions in the
   city in 2019 to hear residents' claims about the police department.
   Johnson said more than 80 people spoke at the hearings, and dozens more
   filed complaints with the civil rights department.

   The formal charges announced Thursday come a week after the city was
   hit with [195]a $100 million civil lawsuit that alleges racial
   discrimination in the killing of Patrick Lyoya. A Grand Rapids police
   officer shot and killed Lyoya following a traffic stop in April. Lyoya
   was Black and had no weapon when he was stopped.

   And earlier this month, Grand Rapids city commissioners [196]approved
   paying more than $300,000 to settle a lawsuit over the police
   department violating the civil rights of two Black men it stopped in
   2011. Police took photos and fingerprints of the two men, Denishio
   Johnson and Keyon Harrison, after stopping them -- though neither was
   accused of any crime. The Michigan Supreme Court [197]ruled this year
   that the policy of photographing and fingerprinting innocent people
   violated the Fourth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution.

   The ACLU of Michigan said 75% of the people GRPD photographed and
   fingerprinted under the policy were Black.

   On December 6, Grand Rapids City Commissioners [198]agreed to settle
   the 11-year old lawsuit by paying Harrison and Johnson $30,000 each,
   and paying the ACLU of Michigan $270,000 in legal fees.

   racialdiscrimination In The USA

   The USA has had a very bad history when it comes to racial
   discrimination. The country in 18th century brought lot of slave
   workers and they all were from Africa and Asia. These people did not
   have any rights. The culture of racialdiscrimination continued for
   such a long time that it became embedded in the people's minds. Now its
   very natural for the people to see other races as unworthy and down.
   Many Indians have also faced a lot of problems in the past due to the
   racial abuse. The people do not get promotions in their jobs and they
   do not get equal salary as their white counterparts. Some are even
   subjected to violence. Lot of Indian Sikhs have been murdered and at
   the receiving end of physical abuse in the USA.

   On top of that Barack Obama said that religious tolerance in India has
   been going down!

   Formal racialdiscrimination was largely banned in the mid-20th
   century, and ... In the view of the U.S. Human Rights Network, a
   network of scores of US civil ...

   Dec 7, 2014 ... Addressing protests over minorities killed by police
   officers, President Obama said racism is "deeply rooted" in the U.S.
   and that activists should ...

   Nov 27, 2014 ... Whites and people of color speak a different language
   about racism. ... Bouie of Slate magazine in a recent essay, "The Gulf
   That Divides Us.".

Ask the Expert: What is critical race theory and why is it under attack in
our schools?

   "Ask the Expert" articles provide information and insights from MSU
   scientists, researchers and scholars about national and global issues,
   complex research and general-interest subjects based on their areas of
   academic expertise and study. They may feature historical information,
   background, research findings, or offer tips.

   Michigan joins other states that have introduced legislation that would
   sharply limit classroom discussions on how race and racism have shaped
   American history.


   [36]Dorinda Carter Andrews, professor and chairperson, [37]Department
   of Teacher Education at Michigan State University's [38]College of
   Education, said this is an ill-formed conflation, and answers other
   questions about critical race theory.


   Dorinda Carter Andrews, professor and chairperson, Department of
   Teacher Education at Michigan State University's College of Education.


   What is critical race theory?


   Critical race theory, or CRT, is a framework developed in the 1970s by
   legal scholars that argues white supremacy maintains power through the
   law and other legal systems. CRT dismisses the idea that racism stems
   from acts of individuals but rather rooted in a system of oppression
   based on socially constructed racial hierarchy where white people reap
   material benefits over people of color resulting from misuse of
   power.


   Teaching young people about race and racism is not synonymous with
   teaching them critical race theory. Critical race theory is not an
   ideology or a political orientation that assumes white people are bad;
   it assumes white supremacy is bad in all of its forms. It's a practice
   or approach that provides language and a lens for examining racism at
   institutional and structural levels. Underlying this is the premise
   that racism is endemic to American society and that white supremacist
   ideals and practices should be dismantled.



   Why are there proposals to ban critical race theory in schools?


   As of mid-May, legislation to outlaw CRT in schools [39]has passed in
   Idaho, Iowa, Oklahoma and Tennessee and have been proposed in various
   other statehouses. Since the onset of teaching about American history,
   teachers have been teaching about forms of systemic racial
   discrimination and oppression, including slavery. This is not new to
   schools. However, traditionally school curriculums have taken a
   Eurocentric approach.


   Now we are living in a time where the voices of people of color are
   being lifted up, and tragic events like George Floyd's death one year
   ago and violence against members of the Asian panethnic community prove
   that problems remain. The narrative of U.S. history is being
   diversified, and that is creating fear, particularly among white
   people. Teaching young people how to be antiracist should not be seen
   as an attack on American values. It's actually working in support of
   American ideals like inclusion and valuing diverse perspectives.



   Why is it important for students to learn about systemic racism in
   schools?


   It's important to try to help youth understand how bias and oppression
   are institutional, structural and systemic, and not simply
   interpersonal. Young people are not colorblind or color mute. They see
   color and they talk race and racism in their own social circles and
   peer groups. Research indicates that as early as age 3, children have
   negative associations about some racial groups. By the time they enter
   elementary school, children already have a level of racial literacy
   that evidences their awareness that some individuals and groups are
   treated differently in their schools and society based on skin color.
   This is particularly apparent for elementary-aged children of color. If
   children of color are old enough to experience racialdiscrimination
   and injustice, then all children, especially white children, are old
   enough to learn about racism in ways that enhance their cross-cultural
   competency, racial literacy skills and skill set for improving our
   democracy.



   What is proposed in the Michigan legislation?


   A new bill introduced to the Michigan Legislature would sharply limit
   Michigan classroom discussions of how race and racism have shaped
   American history. Under the legislation introduced, K-12 school
   districts would lose 5% of their funding if educators teach critical
   race theory, "anti-American" ideas about race in America, or material
   from The 1619 Project, a New York Times initiative that puts Black
   history and the consequences of slavery at the center of the U.S.
   national narrative. School funding penalties tied to implementing
   antiracist curriculum is actually a racist move that furthers systemic
   racial oppression in education, disadvantages all children, and upholds
   white supremacist ideals.



   What are the possible consequences of this legislation?


   The bills are vague and it's unclear what they will cover and if they
   are constitutional, or whether they impermissibly restrict free speech.


   It would be difficult to monitor what goes on inside hundreds of
   thousands of classrooms. Educators fear that such laws could have a
   sobering effect on teachers who might censor lessons out of concern for
   parent or administrator complaints. Additionally, such bills can
   actually work to undermine educational goals of diversifying the
   teaching workforce. Students of color may be less likely to pursue a
   teaching career if there is censorship around race talk across subject
   areas.

West Texas Parents Suing Schools Over Racism, Demand Action Over Antisemitism

School leaders have said they don't tolerate racism or bullying. But parents
say inaction by officials tells a different story

   LUBBOCK -- Parents, full of anger and disbelief, have confronted school
   leaders in the Lubbock area over a series of racist and antisemitic
   incidents in several schools.

   In total, four separate incidents have come to light in recent weeks.

   Two episodes -- both involving Black students targeted in constant
   bullying by their peers and inaction by school officials, parents say
   -- have led to separate federal civil rights lawsuits.

   At the heart of the two lawsuits is the pain parents say their children
   have endured as a result of months of constant and violent bullying --
   including an Instagram account that posted photos of Black students
   from a Lubbock middle school with racist captions, and racial
   discrimination by school officials against students at the high school
   in Slaton, about 17 miles south of Lubbock.

   A third South Plains school district -- Roosevelt ISD -- had a parent
   file a federal complaint against them for racialdiscrimination by
   school officials. There, a mother took her daughter out of school after
   she claims school officials targeted her child for undue disciplinary
   actions.

   Meanwhile, a threatening antisemitic petition was passed around by a
   student at another Lubbock middle school. Parents say they are
   disappointed the school hasn't had a strong response.

   On their own, these might seem like isolated incidents of school-age
   angst. However, racially driven and antisemitic incidents are on the
   [82]rise in Texas. And now four different school districts in the South
   Plains are facing tensions emblematic of the widespread problem.
   Instead of addressing it directly, parents say school officials try to
   sweep the issues under the rug.

   Lubbock-Cooper ISD -- which includes Laura Bush Middle School, where
   the Instagram account was based -- declined to comment on the federal
   lawsuit.

   "Racism has no place at any school within Lubbock-Cooper ISD," the
   district added in a statement. "It is not a reflection of our beliefs
   as a school and it completely contradicts the virtues we wish to
   instill in our students."

   were allegedly bullied over months, including with an Instagram account
   that posted photos of them with racist captions. (Mark Rogers/The Texas
   Tribune)

   Lubbock parents are grappling with sending their children to schools
   where they may not feel safe because of their skin color or religion,
   particularly with officials at the helm who parents no longer trust.

   "They know that there's a problem but they don't want to do anything
   about it," said Tracy Kemp, a mother of three kids in the
   Lubbock-Cooper district and a participant in the federal complaint.
   "They would rather us leave than to change."

   Black students make up 3% of Lubbock-Cooper's student body. The
   complaint, which was a joint filing with the families, Intercultural
   Development Research Association and the Lubbock NAACP, alleges the
   school is known for its frequent, consistent and extreme discriminatory
   practices against its Black students.

   The Lubbock-Cooper school district covers Southwest Lubbock, serving
   families on the farthest edges of Lubbock's newest developed area and
   families from nearby communities.

   The complaint details the near-daily harassment and bullying several
   Black students had to endure since last spring, which included being
   called racial slurs and hearing the sounds of cracking whips as they
   walked through the halls.

   The complaint also alleges that the incidents -- which lasted for
   months -- would often lead to physical threats and acts of violence
   against Black students by their white peers. Kemp's son was one of the
   students targeted in these assaults. Kemp thinks the attacks escalated
   because she was bringing attention to the matter. The school, she said,
   still hasn't had a meaningful response in more than eight months.

   "They have nothing to show for it because they've done nothing about
   it," Kemp said. "They've put out damage control statements because
   we've gone to the press, but they've never come to us."

   Parents reported the hostile acts to school administration, but they
   say officials didn't take action to end the harassment and would often
   punish the victims. Lubbock-Cooper ISD said it has responded to
   complaints by instituting more diversity training among teachers,
   administrators and students.

   south of Lubbock. (Mark Rogers/The Texas Tribune)

   Similar [83]incidents were reported in the complaint against Slaton
   High School, where there are about 20 Black students. In one instance,
   the lawsuit claims, a Black student faced unfair punishment for
   retaliating against a white student for repeatedly calling her racist
   slurs. In a statement to [84]NBC News, Slaton Superintendent Jim Andrus
   said the district trains staff regularly on how to address bullying
   allegations.

   At Hutchinson Middle School in Lubbock, a parent alleged a student
   asked peers to sign a sheet of paper after calling for violence against
   Jewish people, according to emails obtained by The Texas Tribune. The
   parent suggested not all students who signed understood what it was for
   and some students signed, with real and fake names.

   Administrators determined there was not an imminent threat to students
   and did not send out an email informing the public, despite being asked
   to do so by a Jewish parent. The school district claimed sending an
   email out would be a violation of the Family Educational Rights and
   Privacy Act because it could reveal the student's identity.

   Lubbock Rabbi Deborah Goldmann emailed the principal and superintendent
   about the incident. In emails obtained by the Tribune, Goldmann said
   the community learns the behavior is acceptable because there was no
   response.

   asked peers to sign a sheet of paper calling for violence against
   Jewish people, according to emails obtained by The Texas Tribune. (Mark
   Rogers/The Texas Tribune)

   Michael Stewart, the principal of Hutchinson Middle School, responded
   to her saying the school has addressed the behavior with the individual
   involved and students who signed and that they are developing lessons
   to address the cultural and religious backgrounds of students.

   "It does seem that you are beating around the bush and uncomfortable
   addressing antisemitism," Goldmann wrote back. "If they felt
   comfortable going around asking people to sign that paper, they are in
   an environment where other students feel the same level of comfort."

   Roosevelt ISD, 10 miles east of Lubbock, is also facing an official
   complaint with the U.S. Department of Education's Office for Civil
   Rights. Kristen Arnold alleges that her daughter was being racially
   discriminated against by school officials and was falling behind in
   classes because of unjust punishments. In an effort to protect her
   daughter's mental health, Arnold pulled her from Roosevelt High School
   just before her senior year. She is now doing a homeschool program to
   be able to graduate.

   "They literally harassed her right out of high school," Arnold told the
   Tribune. "She's been struggling with depression and anxiety."

   According to emails obtained by the Tribune, Arnold shared her concerns
   and attempted to meet with Roosevelt Superintendent Dallas Grimes about
   the problem in May. In response, Grimes said they have heard her
   grievances and were aware of the report she was filing.

   "Unless there is new information to educate me on, I'm not sure what
   the purpose of the meeting would be," the email reads.

   Arnold was intimidated by the response and withdrew her complaints, but
   refiled in June. The case is now pending at the federal department of
   education. In an email to the Tribune, Grimes said the district knew
   she withdrew her complaints but was unaware of the new filing.

DOJ touts first-of-its-kind settlement in racialdiscrimination case
targeting 'crime-free housing' policy

   The US Justice Department on Wednesday filed what it is describing as a
   first-of-its-kind settlement in a racialdiscrimination case
   challenging a so-called "crime-free housing ordinance."

   CNN -- The US Justice Department on Wednesday filed what it is
   describing as a first-of-its-kind settlement in a racialdiscrimination
   case challenging a so-called "crime-free housing ordinance."

   The proposed consent decree was filed Wednesday in a lawsuit the
   Justice Department brought in 2019 against the central California city
   of Hesperia, alleging that the city's ordinance violated the Fair
   Housing Act's prohibitions on racialdiscrimination in housing access.

   Hesperia continues to deny the allegations.

   According to DOJ's court filings, the 2015 ordinance instructed
   landlords to evict tenants accused of criminal conduct, even if those
   allegations have not resulted in an arrest or a conviction.

   "As our complaint makes clear, Hesperia's ordinance was a blatantly
   racially discriminatory solution to a problem that didn't exist,"
   Assistant Attorney General Kristen Clark, who leads the DOJ Civil
   Rights division, said on a press call Wednesday.

   She noted under the program, Black renters were almost four times more
   likely to be evicted than White renters and Latino renters were 29%
   more likely to be evicted.

   She said that some 2,000 jurisdictions across 48 states have enacted
   similar policies and that the new settlement sent a signal to other
   communities that they'd be held accountable if their housing policies
   violated anti-discrimination law.

   "This landmark agreement is historic," Clark said. "It marks the
   Justice Department's first settlement in a case challenge a crime-free
   ordinance and results in the full repeal of the program and nearly $1
   million in monetary commitment."

   Last month, the city repealed the ordinance, which was previously
   amended in 2017 to make the program voluntary. According to the Justice
   Department, Hesperia and its co-defendants -- the county of San
   Bernardino and the San Bernardino Sheriffs Department -- have agreed to
   pay a $950,000 settlement.

   It will compensate people who were harmed under the policy and will
   cover anti-discrimination training and other initiatives.

   A lawyer for Hesperia said that the city's move to resolve the case
   "was based solely on a sound financial decision on behalf of the
   citizens of the City."

   "At no time has the City admitted liability in this matter, and the
   City continues to vehemently deny all allegations contained within the
   complaint filed by the Department of Justice," the lawyer, J. Pat
   Ferraris told CNN in an email.

The Latest Threat to the Voting Rights Act: Merrill v. Milligan

   Blog / Last Updated: December 8, 2022

   Share this:

   This blog was written by legal intern Gabby Means.

   In the last decade, the US Supreme Court has severely weakened the
   Voting Rights Act of 1965 (VRA), which was widely agreed to be [34]the
   most effective civil rights law in our history.

   Beginning with its 2013 decision in Shelby County v. Holder, which
   [35]gutted the VRA by [36]rendering Section 5 ineffective, the Court
   has chipped away at the power of the VRA. Most recently, the Court
   weakened Section 2 of the VRA, one of the last protections against
   racially discriminatory voting laws. It did so in the 2021 decision in
   Brnovich v. Democratic National Committee, where the Court [37]made it
   more difficult for voting rights plaintiffs to challenge racially
   discriminatory voting laws in court.

   This term, the Court considers Section 2 again in [38]Merrill v.
   Milligan. This time, the Court threatens to weaken well-established
   precedent lower courts have used for decades to evaluate redistricting
   plans alleged to be racially discriminatory. In this blog, we will
   explore the history of Section 2 and its impact on discriminatory
   redistricting plans, explain the dispute at issue in Milligan, and
   preview potential next steps to protect voting rights.

Background on the Voting Rights Act

   The VRA was passed in response to deliberate efforts to prevent Black
   Americans from voting, including violence and terror. States --
   particularly in the South -- were thwarting their pro-equality,
   anti-discrimination obligations under the Fourteenth and Fifteenth
   Amendments, and Congress determined further protections were
   required.

   The VRA created remarkable remedies and protections to ensure that no
   one is prevented from participating in the political process because of
   their race. Its core protections are in Section 5 and Section 2 of the
   Act. Section 5 established a system of "federal preclearance," which
   required jurisdictions with a history of racialdiscrimination in
   voting to seek preapproval before making any changes to their voting
   practices. For voters harmed by jurisdictions with racially
   discriminatory voting policies and practices, Section 2 provided them
   with legal recourse.

   The Voting Rights Act was reauthorized -- with strong bipartisan
   support -- multiple times, most recently in 2006. But in 2013, the US
   Supreme Court held that the Section 5 coverage formula for determining
   which jurisdictions must submit to federal preclearance was not
   justified by current conditions. The decision essentially nullified
   Section 5 until a new coverage formula is passed in Congress (which has
   yet to occur). As the late Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg noted in her
   dissent, "throwing out preclearance when it has worked and is
   continuing to work to stop discriminatory changes is like throwing away
   your umbrella in a rainstorm because you are not getting wet."
   Unsurprisingly, since this decision, several restrictive state voting
   rights laws have been enacted.

   [39]Tell Your Representatives to Restore the VRA!

   Section 2 of the VRA has always been critical to protect voters, but
   without a functioning Section 5, Section 2 is even more necessary to
   challenge policies and practices that intend to or effect of harming
   voters of color. As explored below, Merrill v. Milligan threatens
   Section 2 and voters' ability to use it to challenge racial
   discrimination in voting.

Claims Under Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act: Vote Denial & Vote Dilution

   Under Section 2(a) of the VRA, states may not pass any law that
   "results in a denial or abridgment" of the right to vote "on account of
   race or color." Put simply, Section 2 prohibits any standard, practice,
   or procedure imposed or applied to deny or limit the right to vote
   based on race or color.

   Cases brought under Section 2 [40]have historically involved two types
   of violations:

   1) Vote dilution; and

   2) Vote denial.

Vote Denial

   Vote denial claims typically challenge practices that render voting
   "not equally open to participation" for voters protected by Section 2
   -- racial and language minority groups. They became more common as
   states rushed to pass restrictive voting laws after the Shelby County
   decision. A common vote denial claim post-Shelby County are challenges
   to restrictive photo ID laws that disproportionately prevent voters of
   color from voting.

   Until the ruling in Brnovich, the Supreme Court had not squarely
   addressed Section 2 vote denial claims. [41]As noted in our previous
   blog, the Court in Brnovich dealt a blow to voters' ability to
   challenge racialdiscrimination in voting under Section 2.

Vote Dilution

   [42]The most common and well-established use of Section 2 -- and the
   claim raised in Milligan v. Merrill -- is a vote dilution claim, raised
   [43]in the context of redistricting and changes to jurisdiction
   boundaries. A violation of Section 2 occurs when states draw districts
   in a way that gives voters of color less power "to elect
   representatives of their choice."

   The earliest vote dilution cases concerned at-large voting; an election
   scheme used to drown out the power of voters of color. More recently,
   vote dilution claims have been brought to challenge redistricting plans
   that dilute the political power of Black residents and other
   communities of color on the local, state, and federal levels.

   The Supreme Court has decided several vote dilution cases since the VRA
   was passed in 1965, including Thornburg v. Gingles in 1986, which
   established the test to evaluate claims of racial vote dilution in
   district boundaries. To establish a Section 2 violation under Gingles,
   plaintiffs must show that instead of the challenged map or boundaries
   which dilute the power of voters of color, an acceptable district could
   be drawn that would allow voters of color to elect a candidate of
   choice.

Merrill v. Milligan

   On October 4, 2022, the Supreme Court heard oral arguments in Merrill
   v. Milligan. Plaintiffs -- Alabama voters and voting rights
   organizations -- challenged the congressional map passed by the Alabama
   legislature after the 2020 census. The new map maintained only one
   majority-Black congressional district out of seven total districts,
   despite the fact that 27% of the Alabama population is Black. This
   percentage suggests that there could -- and, according to the Milligan
   plaintiffs, should -- be two districts where Black voters can elect a
   candidate of choice. After the presentation of evidence, a three-judge
   panel at the district court found a likely Section 2 violation and
   irreparable harm to Black voters. The court ordered lawmakers to draw a
   new map that satisfies the requirements of Section 2.

   Instead of accepting the ruling and working to address the violation on
   behalf of the state's Black voters, the state filed an emergency appeal
   to the Supreme Court to halt the lower court order suspending Alabama's
   map. The Supreme Court agreed, which meant that the Alabama
   congressional map, which a three-judge panel had struck down at the
   federal district court, would be in place for the upcoming 2022
   election season. On October 4, 2022, the Supreme Court heard oral
   arguments.

   demanding fair maps

   Merrill v. Milligan is a straightforward vote dilution case, with an
   outcome dictated by Supreme Court precedent. As Justice Kagan noted
   during oral arguments, "this case should be a slam dunk." Even Chief
   Justice Roberts agreed in his dissent to the emergency stay order,
   stating, "the District Court properly applied existing law in an
   extensive opinion with no apparent errors for our correction." So why
   is the Supreme Court hearing this case?

   The state argues that its "race-neutral" map -- which only creates one
   majority-Black congressional district -- should not be disqualified
   just because it is possible to draw two majority-Black districts in
   Alabama. They suggest that the VRA prohibits denying votes on account
   of race but does not affirmatively obligate states to redistrict on
   account of race. The state urges that the first prong of the Gingles
   test, that the community of color must be "sufficiently large and
   geographically compact to constitute a majority in a single-member
   district," should be a race-blind test. Alabama's argument does not
   square with the purpose and history of the VRA, which is specifically
   focused on rooting out racialdiscrimination in voting pursuant to
   Congress's power to enforce the Fourteenth Amendment.

   Alabama voters in the Milligan case argue that Alabama violated Section
   2 by [44]"packing" and "cracking" Black residents to limit their
   political power. Importantly, they also argue that requiring the first
   prong of Gingles to be race-blind would defeat the purpose of Section
   2, which is to protect voters of color from having their political
   power diminished. During oral argument, Supreme Court Justice Ketanji
   Brown Jackson acknowledged the historical importance of race in VRA
   case law, noting that "it became clear to me that the framers
   themselves adopted the equal protection clause, the Fourteenth
   Amendment, the Fifteenth Amendment, in a race-conscious way. That they
   were, in fact, trying to ensure that people who had been discriminated
   against . . . were brought equal to everyone else in the society."

   [45]Learn More About Our Legal Cases

   The League of Women Voters of Alabama and the League of Women Voters of
   the United States filed an amicus brief supporting Alabama voters in
   the case, along with the Southern Poverty Law Center and Stand-Up
   Mobile. The League's brief urges the Supreme Court to uphold the
   district court ruling, which found a violation of Section 2. The brief
   explains how a second majority-Black district can be drawn to satisfy
   Section 2 by combining two communities in Alabama with deep ties to
   each other: the city of Mobile and Alabama's Black Belt. [46]The brief
   can be found here.

What's Next?

   It's essential that the Supreme Court uphold the Alabama district court
   ruling and protect the longstanding protections Section 2 provides for
   voters. Should the Court rule in Alabama's favor, future rulings
   striking down racially discriminatory redistricting plans could be put
   at risk. This is already occurring: in June 2022, [47]a district court
   in Louisiana found a Section 2 violation for that state's congressional
   map, but the decision has stayed pending the outcoming in Milligan. The
   racially discriminatory Louisiana congressional map has thus been
   allowed to go into effect for the 2022 election season. If the Supreme
   Court rules in favor of Alabama, the Louisiana case could suffer the
   same fate.

   This case emphasizes the importance of restoring the Voting Rights Act
   to its full strength and passing federal voting rights protections.
   Encourage your representatives to do so: let Congress know they must
   pass the [48]John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act and the Freedom
   to Vote Act to protect voters from discriminatory and suppressive
   voting practices.

   A decision in Merrill v. Milligan is expected in the spring or summer
   of 2023.

   On July 1, in [53]Brnovich v. Democratic National Committee, the

   decision held that Arizona laws discounting ballots cast out of
   precinct and banning nonrelative neighbors or friends to deliver
   mail-in ballots did not violate the Voting Rights Act of 1965, despite
   these laws' negative effects on Black and brown voters. It is a major

   How we did this
   (BUTTON)

   Pew Research Center conducted this analysis to understand the nuances
   among Black people on issues of racial inequality and social change in
   the United States. This in-depth survey explores differences among
   Black Americans in their views on the social status of the Black
   population in the U.S.; their assessments of racial inequality; their
   visions for institutional and social change; and their outlook on the
   chances that these improvements will be made. The analysis is the
   latest in the Center's [93]series of in-depth surveys of public opinion
   among Black Americans (read the first, "[94]Faith Among Black
   Americans" and "[95]Race Is Central to Identity for Black Americans and
   Affects How They Connect With Each Other").

   The online survey of 3,912 Black U.S. adults was conducted Oct. 4-17,
   2021. Black U.S. adults include those who are single-race, non-Hispanic
   Black Americans; multiracial non-Hispanic Black Americans; and adults
   who indicate they are Black and Hispanic. The survey includes 1,025
   Black adults on Pew Research Center's [96]American Trends Panel (ATP)
   and 2,887 Black adults on Ipsos' KnowledgePanel. Respondents on both
   panels are recruited through national, random sampling of residential
   addresses.

   Recruiting panelists by phone or mail ensures that nearly all U.S.
   Black adults have a chance of selection. This gives us confidence that
   any sample can represent the whole population (see our [97]Methods 101
   explainer on random sampling). Here are the [98]questions used for the
   survey of Black adults, along with its responses and [99]methodology.
   Terminology
   (BUTTON)

   The terms "Black Americans," "Black people" and "Black adults" are used
   interchangeably throughout this report to refer to U.S. adults who
   self-identify as Black, either alone or in combination with other races
   or Hispanic identity.

   Throughout this report, "Black, non-Hispanic" respondents are those who
   identify as single-race Black and say they have no Hispanic background.
   "Black Hispanic" respondents are those who identify as Black and say
   they have Hispanic background. We use the terms "Black Hispanic" and
   "Hispanic Black" interchangeably. "Multiracial" respondents are those
   who indicate two or more racial backgrounds (one of which is Black) and
   say they are not Hispanic.

   Respondents were asked a question about how important being Black was
   to how they think about themselves. In this report, we use the term
   "being Black" when referencing responses to this question.

   In this report, "immigrant" refers to people who were not U.S. citizens
   at birth - in other words, those born outside the U.S., Puerto Rico or
   other U.S. territories to parents who were not U.S. citizens. We use
   the terms "immigrant," "born abroad" and "foreign-born"
   interchangeably.

   Throughout this report, "Democrats and Democratic leaners" and just
   "Democrats" both refer to respondents who identify politically with the
   Democratic Party or who are independent or some other party but lean
   toward the Democratic Party. "Republicans and Republican leaners" and
   just "Republicans" both refer to respondents who identify politically
   with the Republican Party or are independent or some other party but
   lean toward the Republican Party.

   Respondents were asked a question about their voter registration
   status. In this report, respondents are considered registered to vote
   if they self-report being absolutely certain they are registered at
   their current address. Respondents are considered not registered to
   vote if they report not being registered or express uncertainty about
   their registration.

   To create the upper-, middle- and lower-income tiers, respondents' 2020
   family incomes were adjusted for differences in purchasing power by
   geographic region and household size. Respondents were then placed into
   income tiers: "Middle income" is defined as two-thirds to double the
   median annual income for the entire survey sample. "Lower income" falls
   below that range, and "upper income" lies above it. For more
   information about how the income tiers were created, read the
   [100]methodology.
   [101]Bar chart showing after George Floyd's murder, half of Black
   Americans expected policy changes to address racial inequality, After
   George Floyd's murder, half of Black Americans expected policy changes
   to address racial inequality

   More than a year after the murder of George Floyd and the national
   protests, debate and political promises that ensued, 65% of Black
   Americans say the increased national attention on racial inequality has
   not led to changes that improved their lives.^[102]1 And 44% say
   equality for Black people in the United States is not likely to be
   achieved, according to newly released findings from an October 2021
   survey of Black Americans by Pew Research Center.

   This is somewhat of a reversal in views from September 2020, when half
   of Black adults said the increased national focus on issues of race
   would lead to major policy changes to address racial inequality in the
   country and 56% expected changes that would make their lives better.

   At the same time, many Black Americans are concerned about racial
   discrimination and its impact. Roughly eight-in-ten say they have
   personally experienced discrimination because of their race or
   ethnicity (79%), and most also say discrimination is the main reason
   many Black people cannot get ahead (68%).

   Even so, Black Americans have a clear vision for how to achieve change
   when it comes to racial inequality. This includes support for
   significant reforms to or complete overhauls of several U.S.
   institutions to ensure fair treatment, particularly the criminal
   justice system; political engagement, primarily in the form of voting;
   support for Black businesses to advance Black communities; and
   reparations in the forms of educational, business and homeownership
   assistance. Yet alongside their assessments of inequality and ideas
   about progress exists pessimism about whether U.S. society and its
   institutions will change in ways that would reduce racism.

   These findings emerge from an extensive Pew Research Center survey of
   3,912 Black Americans conducted online Oct. 4-17, 2021. The survey
   explores how Black Americans assess their position in U.S. society and
   their ideas about social change. Overall, Black Americans are clear on
   what they think the problems are facing the country and how to remedy
   them. However, they are skeptical that meaningful changes will take
   place in their lifetime.

Black Americans see racism in our laws as a big problem and discrimination as
a roadblock to progress

   [103]Bar chart showing about six-in-ten Black adults say racism and
   police brutality are extremely big problems for Black people in the
   U.S. today

   Black adults were asked in the survey to assess the current nature of
   racism in the United States and whether structural or individual
   sources of this racism are a bigger problem for Black people. About
   half of Black adults (52%) say racism in our laws is a bigger problem
   than racism by individual people, while four-in-ten (43%) say acts of
   racism committed by individual people is the bigger problem. Only 3% of
   Black adults say that Black people do not experience discrimination in
   the U.S. today.

   In assessing the magnitude of problems that they face, the majority of
   Black Americans say racism (63%), police brutality (60%) and economic
   inequality (54%) are extremely or very big problems for Black people
   living in the U.S. Slightly smaller shares say the same about the
   affordability of health care (47%), limitations on voting (46%), and
   the quality of K-12 schools (40%).

   Aside from their critiques of U.S. institutions, Black adults also feel
   the impact of racial inequality personally. Most Black adults say they
   occasionally or frequently experience unfair treatment because of their
   race or ethnicity (79%), and two-thirds (68%) cite racial
   discrimination as the main reason many Black people cannot get ahead
   today.

Black Americans' views on reducing racial inequality

   [104]Bar chart showing many Black adults say institutional overhauls
   are necessary to ensure fair treatment

   Black Americans are clear on the challenges they face because of
   racism. They are also clear on the solutions. These range from
   overhauls of policing practices and the criminal justice system to
   civic engagement and reparations to descendants of people enslaved in
   the United States.

Changing U.S. institutions such as policing, courts and prison systems

   About nine-in-ten Black adults say multiple aspects of the criminal
   justice system need some kind of change (minor, major or a complete
   overhaul) to ensure fair treatment, with nearly all saying so about
   policing (95%), the courts and judicial process (95%), and the prison
   system (94%).

   Roughly half of Black adults say policing (49%), the courts and
   judicial process (48%), and the prison system (54%) need to be
   completely rebuilt for Black people to be treated fairly. Smaller
   shares say the same about the political system (42%), the economic
   system (37%) and the health care system (34%), according to the October
   survey.

   While Black Americans are in favor of significant changes to policing,
   most want spending on police departments in their communities to stay
   the same (39%) or increase (35%). A little more than one-in-five (23%)
   think spending on police departments in their area should be decreased.

   Black adults who favor decreases in police spending are most likely to
   name medical, mental health and social services (40%) as the top
   priority for those reappropriated funds. Smaller shares say K-12
   schools (25%), roads, water systems and other infrastructure (12%), and
   reducing taxes (13%) should be the top priority.

Voting and `buying Black' viewed as important strategies for Black community
advancement

   Black Americans also have clear views on the types of political and
   civic engagement they believe will move Black communities forward.
   About six-in-ten Black adults say voting (63%) and supporting Black
   businesses or "buying Black" (58%) are extremely or very effective
   strategies for moving Black people toward equality in the U.S. Smaller
   though still significant shares say the same about volunteering with
   organizations dedicated to Black equality (48%), protesting (42%) and
   contacting elected officials (40%).

   Black adults were also asked about the effectiveness of [105]Black
   economic and political independence in moving them toward equality.
   About four-in-ten (39%) say Black ownership of all businesses in Black
   neighborhoods would be an extremely or very effective strategy for
   moving toward racial equality, while roughly three-in-ten (31%) say the
   same about establishing a national Black political party. And about a
   quarter of Black adults (27%) say having Black neighborhoods governed
   entirely by Black elected officials would be extremely or very
   effective in moving Black people toward equality.

Most Black Americans support repayment for slavery

   Discussions about atonement for slavery predate the founding of the
   United States. [106]As early as 1672, Quaker abolitionists advocated
   for enslaved people to be paid for their labor once they were free. And
   in recent years, some [107]U.S. cities and [108]institutions have
   implemented reparations policies to do just that.

   Most Black Americans say the legacy of slavery affects the position of
   Black people in the U.S. either a great deal (55%) or a fair amount
   (30%), according to the survey. And roughly three-quarters (77%) say
   descendants of people enslaved in the U.S. should be repaid in some
   way.

   Black adults who say descendants of the enslaved should be repaid
   support doing so in different ways. About eight-in-ten say repayment in
   the forms of educational scholarships (80%), financial assistance for
   starting or improving a business (77%), and financial assistance for
   buying or remodeling a home (76%) would be extremely or very helpful. A
   slightly smaller share (69%) say cash payments would be extremely or
   very helpful forms of repayment for the descendants of enslaved people.

   Where the responsibility for repayment lies is also clear for Black
   Americans. Among those who say the descendants of enslaved people
   should be repaid, 81% say the U.S. federal government should have all
   or most of the responsibility for repayment. About three-quarters (76%)
   say businesses and banks that profited from slavery should bear all or
   most of the responsibility for repayment. And roughly six-in-ten say
   the same about colleges and universities that benefited from slavery
   (63%) and descendants of families who engaged in the slave trade (60%).

Black Americans are skeptical change will happen

   [109]Bar chart showing little hope among Black adults that changes to
   address racial inequality are likely

   Even though Black Americans' visions for social change are clear, very
   few expect them to be implemented. Overall, 44% of Black adults say
   equality for Black people in the U.S. is a little or not at all likely.
   A little over a third (38%) say it is somewhat likely and only 13% say
   it is extremely or very likely.

   They also do not think specific institutions will change. Two-thirds of
   Black adults say changes to the prison system (67%) and the courts and
   judicial process (65%) that would ensure fair treatment for Black
   people are a little or not at all likely in their lifetime. About
   six-in-ten (58%) say the same about policing. Only about one-in-ten say
   changes to policing (13%), the courts and judicial process (12%), and
   the prison system (11%) are extremely or very likely.

   This pessimism is not only about the criminal justice system. The
   majority of Black adults say the political (63%), economic (62%) and
   health care (51%) systems are also unlikely to change in their
   lifetime.

   Black Americans' vision for social change includes reparations.
   However, much like their pessimism about institutional change, very few
   think they will see reparations in their lifetime. Among Black adults
   who say the descendants of people enslaved in the U.S. should be
   repaid, 82% say reparations for slavery are unlikely to occur in their
   lifetime. About one-in-ten (11%) say repayment is somewhat likely,
   while only 7% say repayment is extremely or very likely to happen in
   their lifetime.

Black Democrats, Republicans differ on assessments of inequality and visions
for social change

   [110]Bar chart showing Black adults differ by party in their views on
   racialdiscrimination and changes to policing

   Party affiliation is one key point of difference among Black Americans
   in their assessments of racial inequality and their visions for social
   change. Black Republicans and Republican leaners are more likely than
   Black Democrats and Democratic leaners to focus on the acts of
   individuals. For example, when summarizing the nature of racism against
   Black people in the U.S., the majority of Black Republicans (59%) say
   racist acts committed by individual people is a bigger problem for
   Black people than racism in our laws. Black Democrats (41%) are less
   likely to hold this view.

   Black Republicans (45%) are also more likely than Black Democrats (21%)
   to say that Black people who cannot get ahead in the U.S. are mostly
   responsible for their own condition. And while similar shares of Black
   Republicans (79%) and Democrats (80%) say they experience racial
   discrimination on a regular basis, Republicans (64%) are more likely
   than Democrats (36%) to say that most Black people who want to get
   ahead can make it if they are willing to work hard.

   On the other hand, Black Democrats are more likely than Black
   Republicans to focus on the impact that racial inequality has on Black
   Americans. Seven-in-ten Black Democrats (73%) say racialdiscrimination
   is the main reason many Black people cannot get ahead in the U.S, while
   about four-in-ten Black Republicans (44%) say the same. And Black
   Democrats are more likely than Black Republicans to say racism (67% vs.
   46%) and police brutality (65% vs. 44%) are extremely big problems for
   Black people today.

   Black Democrats are also more critical of U.S. institutions than Black
   Republicans are. For example, Black Democrats are more likely than
   Black Republicans to say the prison system (57% vs. 35%), policing (52%
   vs. 29%) and the courts and judicial process (50% vs. 35%) should be
   completely rebuilt for Black people to be treated fairly.

   While the share of Black Democrats who want to see large-scale changes
   to the criminal justice system exceeds that of Black Republicans, they
   share similar views on police funding. Four-in-ten each of Black
   Democrats and Black Republicans say funding for police departments in
   their communities should remain the same, while around a third of each
   partisan coalition (36% and 37%, respectively) says funding should
   increase. Only about one-in-four Black Democrats (24%) and one-in-five
   Black Republicans (21%) say funding for police departments in their
   communities should decrease.

   Among the survey's other findings:

   Black adults differ by age in their views on political strategies.
   Black adults ages 65 and older (77%) are most likely to say voting is
   an extremely or very effective strategy for moving Black people toward
   equality. They are significantly more likely than Black adults ages 18
   to 29 (48%) and 30 to 49 (60%) to say this. Black adults 65 and older
   (48%) are also more likely than those ages 30 to 49 (38%) and 50 to 64
   (42%) to say protesting is an extremely or very effective strategy.
   Roughly four-in-ten Black adults ages 18 to 29 say this (44%).

   Gender plays a role in how Black adults view policing. Though
   majorities of Black women (65%) and men (56%) say police brutality is
   an extremely big problem for Black people living in the U.S. today,
   Black women are more likely than Black men to hold this view. When it
   comes to criminal justice, Black women (56%) and men (51%) are about
   equally likely to share the view that the prison system should be
   completely rebuilt to ensure fair treatment of Black people. However,
   Black women (52%) are slightly more likely than Black men (45%) to say
   this about policing. On the matter of police funding, Black women (39%)
   are slightly more likely than Black men (31%) to say police funding in
   their communities should be increased. On the other hand, Black men are
   more likely than Black women to prefer that funding stay the same (44%
   vs. 36%). Smaller shares of both Black men (23%) and women (22%) would
   like to see police funding decreased.

   Income impacts Black adults' views on reparations. Roughly eight-in-ten
   Black adults with lower (78%), middle (77%) and upper incomes (79%) say
   the descendants of people enslaved in the U.S. should receive
   reparations. Among those who support reparations, Black adults with
   upper and middle incomes (both 84%) are more likely than those with
   lower incomes (75%) to say educational scholarships would be an
   extremely or very helpful form of repayment. However, of those who
   support reparations, Black adults with lower (72%) and middle incomes
   (68%) are more likely than those with higher incomes (57%) to say cash
   payments would be an extremely or very helpful form of repayment for
   slavery.

       and equality in the United States in the October 2021 survey.
       Throughout the rest of this report, Black adults include those who
       say their race is Black alone and non-Hispanic; those who say their
       race is Black and at least one other race and non-Hispanic; or
       Black and Hispanic, unless otherwise noted. [120]&#8617;

Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac Can Support Racial Equity in Homeownership and
Environmental Justice Efforts

   The government-sponsored enterprises are in a unique position to reduce
   the racial homeownership gap while simultaneously addressing climate
   change-related risks and systemic environmental racism.

Introduction and summary

   America's legacy of segregation and racialdiscrimination--particularly
   in the area of housing--has made communities of color more vulnerable
   to the effects of climate change. People of color are more likely than
   white people to reside in low-income neighborhoods, which have fewer
   economic and political resources to prepare for and recover from
   natural disasters and address the risks posed by environmental
   hazards.[81]^1And while climate change affects all Americans,
   communities of color are disproportionately exposed and susceptible to
   environmental hazards and natural disasters compared with affluent and
   white communities.[82]^2

   Racial inequalities in homeownership, the racial wealth gap, and racial
   disparities in climate risks and exposure to environmental hazards
   require a robust federal policy response to dismantle decadeslong
   inequities and achieve a just and equitable society. Key to that
   response are Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac--the government-sponsored
   enterprises (GSEs)--which own or guarantee more than 60 percent of the
   nation's home mortgages, including more than half of single-family home
   mortgage loans.[83]^3 These two organizations are uniquely positioned
   to reduce the nation's racial homeownership and wealth gaps while
   promoting climate and environmental resilience in communities of
   color.[84]^4

   The GSEs--also known as the enterprises--can close racial housing and
   wealth gaps and address environmental racism by including climate risk
   and environmental justice considerations when designating areas that
   are underserved by mortgage lending and by prioritizing the types of
   investment activities that reverse decades of environmental racism and
   promote economic stability, natural disaster risk mitigation, and
   climate resilience. Following the Biden administration's
   recommendations, federal agencies throughout the entire policy spectrum
   have begun to respond to the challenges of climate change, which are
   deeply intertwined with racial inequities. Moreover, such inequalities
   have a substantial geographic component. Therefore, when addressing
   them, it is critical for policies to explicitly target underserved
   communities of color to reverse the decadeslong patterns of
   discriminatory practices and disinvestment.

   However, the GSEs find themselves in a serious dilemma. Congress
   requires them to promote access to mortgage credit in underserved
   markets, which are typically more vulnerable to climate risks.
   Meanwhile, the GSEs need to minimize their risk of losses due to
   climate change without further disadvantaging those communities.[87]^5
   For example, natural disasters that damage or destroy homes with
   mortgage loans held by the enterprises jeopardize borrowers' ability to
   make principal and interest payments on mortgage loans, often leading
   to an increase in delinquencies, default rates, and loan losses in the
   enterprises' books of business. In addition, the risks that climate
   change poses to the GSEs represent a severe challenge for the
   securitization of mortgages in low-income communities and communities
   of color.

   Amid an increased awareness of the risks that climate change poses to
   the nation's housing finance system, the Federal Housing Finance Agency
   (FHFA), which oversees the GSEs, recently committed to address climate
   change to ensure that its regulated entities account for
   climate-related risks and natural disasters while continuing to fulfill
   their missions. Such commitment represents a significant step forward
   to ensure greater access to equitable and sustainable homeownership and
   to account for the risks associated with climate change and natural
   disasters. However, these initiatives need to be enhanced through
   concrete and actionable strategies to boost resiliency to climate
   change while promoting sustainable homeownership in underserved
   communities of color.

   To ensure the GSEs fulfill their mission to support equitable and
   sustainable homeownership in underserved communities of color and
   simultaneously address the growing threat of climate change to the
   housing market--a threat that disproportionately affects communities of
   color--the Center for American Progress offers the following policy
   recommendations:
     * Include climate change and environmental justice considerations
       when setting affordable housing goals, benchmarks, and criteria.
       The FHFA should collect climate and environmental justice data to
       assess the risks of climate change and environmental hazards on
       communities of color. Race, climate, and environmental indicators
       should be key components when formulating location-based affordable
       housing goals in order to promote sustainable homeownership in
       communities of color.
     * Reorient market incentives in targeted communities to promote
       climate resilience and access to affordable housing options in
       safer areas. The FHFA should prioritize investment activities that
       reverse decades of environmental racism and promote economic
       stability, natural disaster risk mitigation, and climate resilience
       in underserved communities of color. At the same time, the GSEs
       should ensure that communities of color have access to affordable
       homeownership in safer areas.
     * Promote collaboration and alignment with other agencies. The FHFA
       should promote and support collaboration and alignment among
       different agencies' data collection and distribution, especially
       regarding the geographic targets set for the affordable housing
       goals.
     * Improve the distribution of climate-related costs and protect
       borrowers of color. The GSEs should partner with the Federal
       Housing Administration (FHA) to avoid shifting climate-related
       costs from the enterprises to the U.S. Department of Housing and
       Urban Development (HUD). In addition, the FHFA should spread the
       risk across the enterprises' entire portfolio rather than price it
       into individual loans.

Communities of color are on the front lines of climate and environmental
risks

   The United States is becoming increasingly diverse. Data from the 2020
   census reveal that the country's population of color is rapidly
   growing, whereas the white population is declining. As demographer
   William H. Frey puts it, racial and ethnic diversity is taking
   "different forms in different places."[88]^6 While Black people are
   concentrated in the South and spill into several urban areas in the
   North and parts of the West, the growing Hispanic population is largely
   concentrated in the Southwest as well in the Western part of the
   country. As a result, Hispanic populations routinely share
   neighborhoods with other nonwhite groups, including Black, Asian and
   Pacific Islander, and Native American populations. Racial and ethnic
   diversity is becoming more prevalent everywhere, both in the form of a
   high representation of one group or,[89]^7 increasingly, a high
   representation of two or more nonwhite groups.[90]^8 (see Figure 1)

   Despite the fact that people of color are projected to soon become the
   majority of the U.S. population, they still lag behind non-Hispanic
   white people in homeownership and in their ability to accumulate
   wealth. (see Figure 2)

   In addition to the disparities noted above, natural disasters pose
   unequal risks to communities of color. A report released in late 2021
   by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) shows that even
   though climate change affects all Americans, people of color and
   low-income people are disproportionately exposed to the highest impacts
   of climate change, including those associated with extreme temperatures
   and coastal and inland flooding.[105]^9 Systemic racism has socially
   and economically disadvantaged communities of color, making them more
   susceptible to environmental hazards and natural disasters than white
   communities.[106]^10 People of color are more likely than white people
   to reside in low-income neighborhoods that have fewer economic and
   political resources to prepare for and recover from natural disasters
   and address the risks that environmental hazards pose to their
   communities.[107]^11 (see Figure 3)

   The discriminatory policies and practices of the past played a
   significant role in the levels of vulnerability to environmental
   hazards and natural disasters that communities of color experience
   today. Historical redlining practices,[115]^12 restrictive covenants,
   slum-clearance projects, and the siting of affordable and subsidized
   housing have contributed to the concentration of people of color in
   disinvested neighborhoods that are more likely than other communities
   to feature outdated housing lacking adequate insulation, flood
   proofing, off-grid energy, and air conditioning.[116]^13 A 2021 study
   conducted by Redfin shows that homes located in formerly redlined areas
   are more likely to be at high risk of flooding than those located in
   nonredlined areas.[117]^14 Communities of color are more likely than
   white communities to reside in low-lying sites that are vulnerable to
   flooding, such as inland flood risk zones and coastal communities
   experiencing rising sea levels.[118]^15

   As the United States becomes increasingly diverse, natural disasters
   represent a growing threat to communities of color. The constant
   overexposure of these communities to environmental hazards and risks
   makes them even more vulnerable to climate-related natural disasters.
   Because residential patterns vary greatly by racial and ethnic
   group--and because some areas face elevated natural risks--some groups
   face a greater exposure to natural risk than others.[119]^16 These
   differences, which are quantified in Table 1 and illustrated in Figure
   4 through Figure 12, underscore the importance of the targeted policy
   responses recommended in this report.

   Of the nearly 2 million Americans residing in close proximity to sites
   that are vulnerable to flooding, the majority are people of
   color.[127]^17 However, official counts often underestimate the actual
   size of vulnerable populations living in the 100-year flood plain or in
   other areas at high risk of flooding, making preparedness and relief
   efforts particularly challenging.[128]^18 As Table 1 illustrates,
   census tracts at very high risk of hydrometeorological natural
   disasters such as hurricanes, coastal flooding, and riverine flooding
   are overrepresented by nonwhite racial and ethnic groups. Only 16
   percent of non-Hispanic white people reside in such areas, compared
   with 18 percent of Black people, 19 percent of Hispanic people, and 21
   percent of Native Americans. The geographic distribution of areas at
   high risk of exposure--particularly to hydrometeorological natural
   disasters--largely overlaps with the racial and ethnic distribution of
   U.S. residents. (see Figure 1 and Figure 4) Areas along the Gulf of
   Mexico and coastal Atlantic regions are especially vulnerable to
   hurricanes and coastal flooding. Black and Hispanic populations
   concentrated in such areas are particularly exposed to these types of
   natural disasters. The risk of riverine flooding, on the other hand, is
   more scattered throughout the country, although large pockets of risk
   can be found in the Midwest as well as in the Southwest and Pacific
   regions, particularly where large concentrations of Hispanic, Native
   American, and communities with a mix of two or more races are highly
   concentrated.

   Cities tend to invest more in flood protection in areas with higher
   incomes and property values, depriving low-income communities of color
   of critical flood mitigation.[136]^19 In addition, flood insurance
   premiums are often unaffordable for low-income homeowners of color,
   most of whom do not have the financial resources to make home repairs
   and address the impacts of severe weather events.[137]^20 Low-income
   households own only one-quarter of U.S. homes insured through the
   National Flood Insurance Program,[138]^21 a voluntary partnership
   between local communities and the federal government that is managed by
   the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) and allows property
   owners, renters, and businesses to buy federally backed flood insurance
   to recover from flood-related disasters.[139]^22 A 2019 investigation
   conducted by NPR indicates that federal aid was often allocated based
   on cost-benefits analyses that tended to benefit affluent non-Hispanic
   white communities more than low-income communities and communities of
   color who needed assistance the most.[140]^23 A related study conducted
   by Rice University and the University of Pittsburgh shows that after a
   natural disaster, affluent communities were more likely than low-income
   ones to receive more aid from FEMA, which has important implications
   for the perpetuation of wealth inequality.[141]^24

   Furthermore, a 2021 HUD investigation concerning the Texas General Land
   Office's design and operation of the Hurricane Harvey State Mitigation
   Competition concluded that the state of Texas discriminated based on
   race and national origin when distributing funds to affected
   neighborhoods.[142]^25 Specifically, Texas steered federal funds toward
   white affluent areas by utilizing two scoring criteria that
   substantially disadvantaged Black and Hispanic communities.[143]^26
   This sort of practice is compounded by exclusions that date back to Jim
   Crow laws that discriminated against Black people in legal matters in
   southern states. For example, in the South, more than one-third of
   Black-owned land is still passed down informally within families, often
   for generations, in a process known as "heirs' property." Without
   formal deeds, Black landowners are cut off from federal money,
   including those related to natural disasters.[144]^27

   The inequitable investments made to improve the climate resilience of
   structures in coastal cities often trigger climate gentrification and
   displacement, a process whereby affluent residents of areas at high
   risk of flooding or exposed to rising sea levels--usually in coastal
   cities such as Miami and New Orleans--relocate to safer higher ground,
   often in minority and low-income neighborhoods. This type of relocation
   spurs higher housing prices and eventually displaces longtime
   low-income residents.[145]^28

   People of color also tend to bear the brunt of extreme heat events and
   other climatological natural disasters.[146]^29 Land cover
   characteristics, limited greenspace, the density of buildings and
   structures, and heat-retaining construction materials all combine with
   increasing heat levels to produce what is known as the urban heat
   island effect--particularly in racially segregated areas.[147]^30
   According to data reported by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric
   Administration (NOAA), extreme heat waves represent the most serious
   weather-related threats to human health.[148]^31 Evidence shows that in
   all major urban areas across the nation, the urban heat island effect
   tends to be worse for people of color than for non-Hispanic white
   people and contributes to heat-related health disparities.[149]^32 Heat
   waves are particularly common throughout the Southeast and Midwest
   regions and in large urban areas on the East Coast that are
   characterized by large concentrations of Black people. (see Figure 5)
   Indeed, 22 percent of Black people reside in areas at high risk of
   climatological disasters, most commonly involving heat waves.

   Even though extreme heat waves represent the most common and often
   fatal climatological risk, other types of heat-related disasters are on
   the rise--including wildfires and droughts--that disproportionately
   affect communities of color. (see Figure 5) For example, a University
   of Washington study shows that communities of color and low-income
   communities are much more vulnerable to wildfires than white
   neighborhoods.[157]^33 Specifically, nonwhite communities are 50
   percentage points more vulnerable to wildfires than white
   communities.[158]^34 Although affluent white people are more likely to
   reside in close proximity to the areas at greatest risk of wildfires,
   low-income communities and communities of color are more vulnerable to
   wildfires for the following reasons:
     * They are less likely to be able to afford insurance and any
       mitigation services, such as tree trimming and brush removal.
     * They are more likely to reside in apartment buildings that are
       harder to escape if exits are congested.
     * They are more likely to rent their homes, making them ineligible
       for the federal assistance that typically helps homeowners rebuild
       their properties in the event of a wildfire.
     * They are less likely to own a private vehicle, and therefore may
       have more difficulty evacuating the area.
     * Non-English speakers may not receive or understand evacuation
       notifications in time.[159]^35

   Hispanic, Native American, and Asian American people who are found in
   large concentrations in the Pacific region and Southwest, as well as
   the Rocky Mountains region and Florida, are particularly vulnerable to
   wildfires. Meanwhile, droughts represent a grave threat to Indian
   Country and rural Hispanic communities.[160]^36 Thirty-two percent of
   Native Americans are highly exposed to severe climatological events,
   primarily droughts and wildfires. Native American communities are
   particularly vulnerable due to their lower average income level, as
   well as their history of forced displacement onto federal reservations,
   which placed many of these communities in areas at high risk of
   wildfire.[161]^37

   Decades of environmental racism and historically unequal exposure to
   environmental hazards have made communities of color more vulnerable to
   the risks of natural disasters and hamstrung their ability to respond
   and adapt to climate change.[162]^38 As discussed in a CAP report, "A
   CRA To Meet the Challenge of Climate Change: Advancing the Fight
   Against Environmental Racism," environmental racism is undeniably
   related to climate change because it determines the communities most
   likely to suffer from the consequences of activities that cause global
   warming.[163]^39 People of color are more exposed to pollution from all
   types of sources than white people.[164]^40 People of color are
   estimated to have an air pollution index that is 15 points higher than
   that of white people.[165]^41 Black people, in particular, are
   disproportionately more exposed than other racial and ethnic groups to
   large concentrations of ambient fine particulate air pollution
   (particulate matter 2.5)--the largest environmental cause of
   mortality.[166]^42

   Usually, the disproportionate exposure of people of color to air
   pollution and other pollutants is due to the close proximity of
   racially segregated neighborhoods to highways, industrial plants, and
   other sources of pollution.[167]^43 Areas with a high exposure to
   environmental hazards and risks such as air pollution, lead paint, and
   toxic facilities, among others, largely overlap with areas in which
   different people of color are overrepresented. (see Figure 6) There
   are, however, some geographic and racial variations in the exposure to
   specific types of pollutants. For example, while proximity to toxic
   sites is scattered throughout the U.S. territory and is particularly
   high in urban areas, exposure to air pollutants and lead is remarkably
   high in the Western part of the country, and exposure to respiratory
   hazards and airborne toxic cancer risks is particularly elevated in the
   Southeast region. Compared with non-Hispanic white people, virtually
   all nonwhite racial and ethnic groups are overrepresented in such
   areas. In particular, 41 percent of Black people, 50 percent of Asian
   Americans and Pacific Islanders, and 47 percent of Hispanics reside in
   very close proximity to traffic and toxic sites. Furthermore, more than
   50 percent of Hispanics, 46 percent of Asian Americans and Pacific
   Islanders, and 44 percent of Native Americans are highly exposed to air
   pollutants and lead. Finally, 23 percent of Black people and 21 percent
   of Hispanics are highly susceptible to airborne toxic cancer and
   respiratory hazard risks compared with 10 percent of non-Hispanic white
   people.

   The following sections of this report will discuss the risks that
   climate-related natural disasters pose to the GSEs and the implications
   for communities of color, followed by a series of policy
   recommendations. Specifically, the authors explore how the GSEs could
   contribute to reducing the racial and ethnic homeownership gap while
   simultaneously tackling the risks associated with climate change and
   environmental injustice discussed above.

The risks natural disasters pose to the GSEs and implications for communities
of color

   A trend of worsening hurricanes, wildfires, and floods have resulted in
   billions of dollars in climate-related property losses, particularly to
   homes built in areas that are prone to floods, wildfires, and extreme
   weather.[175]^44 Floods represent the most frequent and costliest
   natural disaster in the United States, resulting in billions of dollars
   of damage every year. Floods are worsening in many areas due to rising
   sea levels, changing weather patterns, and patterns of development that
   have placed homes in high-risk areas.[176]^45 Yet, not all homeowners
   have flood insurance coverage to protect them against losses from
   floods. Only about one-third of U.S. households residing in areas of
   high flood risk are covered by flood insurance.[177]^46

   Major natural disasters can discourage housing activity, such as
   housing construction and purchases. This can result in the
   deterioration of housing conditions in both the affected areas and
   those that are adjacent to them, with rippling negative effects on the
   volume of mortgage loan originations, home prices, rents, and property
   values.[178]^47As property values decrease, the mortgage obligations of
   homeowners residing in vulnerable areas remain fixed, potentially
   increasing negative equity rates and foreclosures. Furthermore, the
   decline of property values has eroded communities' tax bases and
   compromised funding for local municipal services and
   infrastructure.[179]^48 The result is a vicious cycle that can
   drastically reduce the ability of communities--especially low-income
   communities and communities of color--to prepare for and respond to
   natural disasters and rebuild or relocate in the aftermath of severe
   weather events. Extreme natural disasters may spur affluent families to
   move out of disaster-prone areas, leaving behind low-income families
   who do not have the resources to move away. Ultimately, these trends
   can decrease family income levels and increase poverty rates in areas
   hit by severe disasters.[180]^49

   Over the years, the GSEs have purchased and guaranteed a growing
   portion of mortgages for homes in or adjacent to flood plains despite
   the significant risk that floods pose to the housing market.[181]^50As
   a large portion of home mortgages guaranteed by the GSEs are tied to
   homes built in flood plains and areas susceptible to natural disasters,
   climate-related disasters represent a serious concern for the GSEs.
   Borrowers whose homes are damaged or destroyed by natural disasters may
   struggle to make principal and interest payments on their mortgage
   loans, which can lead to more delinquencies,[182]^51 higher default
   rates, and loan losses in the enterprises' books of business.

   Recent evidence shows that in the aftermath of natural disasters,
   mortgage lenders--due to a growing awareness of the risk of mortgage
   defaults posed by climate change-related disasters--are increasingly
   approving loans that can be sold to the GSEs for homes located in flood
   zones and other vulnerable areas. Lenders are thus getting these
   mortgages off their books and transferring climate risk to the
   enterprises and ultimately to U.S. taxpayers.[183]^52 This phenomenon
   is particularly noticeable in areas facing rising sea levels and
   increased flooding in the Southeast Atlantic and Gulf Coast of the
   United States.[184]^53

   CAP analysis of Home Mortgage Disclosure Act data shows that between
   2018 and 2020, the GSEs purchased more than half of single-family home
   loans in areas exposed to different types of natural disasters related
   to climate change. (see Table 2) In particular, throughout that period,
   Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac purchased 56 percent of loans tied to
   single-family properties highly exposed to either coastal flooding or
   wildfires, and they purchased 54 percent of loans in areas that are
   highly exposed to drought.

   The GSEs' ability to address the risks related to climate change has
   been constrained in part because they have no regulatory authority over
   lenders and servicers. According to the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading
   Commission, the GSEs have insufficient discretion to screen and price
   mortgages based on climate risk because they are limited by regulations
   guiding their underwriting activities.[192]^54 In 2019, for example,
   the enterprises guaranteed $6.88 trillion in mortgage loans, but they
   did not price climate risk into their guarantee fees.[193]^55 GSEs do
   not charge a premium that reflects climate risk, which may
   unintentionally encourage residential construction and homebuying in
   the very areas that are vulnerable to climate-related disasters,
   including pricey coastal areas.[194]^56

   To mitigate their risks and shift some of the costs of severe floods
   away from their books of business in the event of unforeseen natural
   disasters, the GSEs impose flood insurance requirements on lenders and
   servicers as a condition of purchasing and servicing loans secured by
   properties located in FEMA-designated special flood hazard areas
   (SFHAs).[195]^57 Nevertheless, several climate-induced damages may not
   be insurable,[196]^58 and it is usually difficult to assess future
   flood-related risks because of the increasing unpredictability of major
   natural disasters. It is challenging to accurately determine which
   properties may experience losses due to climate change-related severe
   events in the future. SFHA maps, in particular, are often outdated and
   do not accurately represent future levels of flood risk.[197]^59 Flood
   models developed by the First Street Foundation, a nonprofit research
   and technology group defining America's climate risks, indicate that
   the flood risk across the nation is much greater than indicated by
   federal government estimates.[198]^60 First Street Foundation estimates
   that 14.6 million properties--8.7 million more properties than in
   government estimates--are at risk of a 100-year flood--one with a 1
   percent chance to hit in any given year. FEMA flood plain maps do not
   reflect risks from all types of floods--including pluvial floods, those
   caused by extreme rainfall--particularly in urbanized areas with a lack
   of permeable surfaces.

   Properties that are located outside the demarcated 100-year flood zones
   and are exposed to heavy precipitation tend to represent a substantial
   portion of flood damage loss.[199]^61 The GSEs hold more than 60
   percent of mortgages on homes in areas outside the 100-year flood
   plain, and fewer homeowners are purchasing federally backed flood
   insurance.[200]^62 Ultimately, the enterprises remain responsible for
   the damaged homes, and taxpayers are left on the hook for mortgage
   defaults when these homes are severely damaged and homeowners are not
   current on flood insurance, cannot sustain repair costs, and are forced
   to abandon their homes.

   The risks that climate change poses to the GSEs represent a serious
   challenge for the securitization of mortgages in low-income communities
   and communities of color. If the GSEs charged higher fees to guarantee
   mortgages on homes located in flood plains, they would
   disproportionally affect low-income communities and communities of
   color that are particularly vulnerable to the effects of climate change
   due to decades of systemic environmental racism.[201]^63 By charging
   higher location-based fees, the enterprises would raise the cost of
   borrowing in underserved communities. In turn, higher borrowing costs
   and insurance premiums would discourage lending in those communities,
   depress home prices, and perpetuate decadeslong patterns of
   disinvestment. The GSEs find themselves in a serious dilemma: Congress
   requires them to promote access to mortgage credit in underserved
   markets, which in turn tend to be particularly vulnerable to climate
   risks. At the same time, the GSEs need to minimize their risk of losses
   due to climate change without putting underserved communities at a
   further disadvantage.[202]^64

   Until recently, the GSEs have addressed climate risks predominantly
   within a disaster response and recovery framework,[203]^65 rather than
   proactively encouraging preparedness and resilience in at-risk
   communities. In 2021, however, the FHFA made a commitment to treat
   climate change impacts as a priority in its oversight of the GSEs and
   to ensure that its regulated entities account for climate-related risks
   and natural disasters while continuing to fulfill their mission to
   provide stability in the secondary market for residential mortgages and
   to promote access to mortgage credit in underserved markets.[204]^66
   Among the actions undertaken by the FHFA in the past two years is the
   addition of resiliency to climate risk as one of the assessment
   criteria in its 2022 scorecard for Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.[205]^67
   In addition, the strategic plan for fiscal years 2022-2026[206]^68
   explicitly addresses climate change as one of the main objectives.
   Specifically, the FHFA states that it will "identify options for
   incorporating climate change into regulated entity governance."

   To accomplish this mission, the FHFA will:
    1. "Conduct research on the risks of climate change on the housing
       finance system, including research specifically analyzing the risks
       and effects for underserved populations."
    2. "Build on experiences with natural disaster response to ensure
       prioritization of climate change at FHFA and the regulated
       entities."
    3. "Improve climate data collection, analysis, and reporting."[207]^69

   To complement the initiatives outlined in the strategic plan, the FHFA
   also directed Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to draft equitable plans with
   the explicit goal of promoting equitable access to affordable and
   sustainable housing by reducing the disparities in racial and ethnic
   homeownership and reducing underinvestment or undervaluation in
   formerly redlined areas.[208]^70

   The equitable housing finance plans for 2022-2024 represent a step
   forward in addressing racial inequalities in access to homeownership.
   In their plans, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac recognize the
   disproportionate risks climate change poses to underserved communities
   of color. However, similar to the strategic plan, the equitable housing
   finance plans seem to emphasize the importance of analytics for
   understating the effects of climate change rather than offering
   concrete and actionable strategies to enhance resiliency to climate
   change while promoting sustainable homeownership in underserved
   communities.[209]^71

   The GSEs already have promising tools to better target underserved
   communities of color to reduce the racial homeownership gap and, at the
   same time, address environmental injustice and the increasing climate
   risk in these communities. Because of the geographic nature of racial
   disparities in homeownership, the racial wealth gap, and the
   disproportionate vulnerability that communities of color have to
   environmental hazards and climate-related disasters, the FHFA should
   direct the GSEs to fine-tune their geographic targeting of communities
   of color through a revision of the proposed single-family affordable
   housing goals, as discussed below.

The enterprises' affordable housing goals

   Congress requires the government-sponsored enterprises to promote
   access to mortgage credit in underserved markets by meeting explicit
   affordable housing goals.[210]^72 The affordable housing goals are
   designed to encourage ongoing assistance to the secondary market for
   conforming home mortgage loans, in particular those for low- and
   moderate-income borrowers. The goals are specified in terms of total
   units financed by GSE purchases in three specific segments of the
   mortgage market: (see Table 3)
    1. Low-income borrowers
    2. Very low-income borrowers
    3. Borrowers in low-income areas

   With the exception of the third goal, which mentions a minority
   presence in geographically targeted areas, the affordable housing goals
   have continued to be based predominantly on economic factors.
   Furthermore, although the third goal explicitly addresses minority
   status, the goals have never distinguished among the racial and ethnic
   groups that make up minority neighborhoods.

   The designation of affordable housing goals has changed periodically
   based on the performance and efforts of the GSEs in achieving the
   targets in previous years.[211]^73 In August 2021, the FHFA announced
   new changes to the current goals to ensure the GSEs responsibly promote
   equitable access to fair and sustainable mortgage financing that
   explicitly reaches communities of color and other underserved
   populations. Specifically, the FHFA has proposed two new single-family
   home purchase subgoals to replace the existing low-income areas
   subgoal. One new subgoal targets minority communities; the other
   continues to target low-income neighborhoods.[212]^74 (see Table 3)

   The new designations of location-based underserved markets clearly do a
   better job including communities of color than older definitions,
   especially from a geographic perspective. (see Figure 7) The proposed
   underserved areas, particularly in the minority census tracts subgoal,
   cover areas characterized by larger percentages of nonwhite racial and
   ethnic groups than the current underserved areas specified in the
   current third goal, especially regarding Black and Hispanic people.
   (see Table 4) Had the proposed new subgoals been effective in the past
   three years, there would have been a clear improvement in targeting
   underserved communities of color and disadvantaged communities. For
   example, had the proposed subgoal one been effective from 2018 to 2020,
   the GSEs would have purchased loans in census tracts in which 63
   percent of the population consists of people of color--a much larger
   percentage compared with that of underserved census tracts targeted by
   current goal three. Census tracts targeted by proposed subgoals one and
   two would have been characterized by lower median household income
   levels and would have included larger percentages of households with a
   housing cost burden and people below 200 percent of the federal poverty
   line.

   No indicators or considerations related to environmental justice and
   climate change are currently included in the criteria adopted for the
   delineation of underserved areas to guide the GSEs in meeting their
   location-based affordable housing goals--even though climate risks, in
   the form of high heat and flood risk, are clearly greater in
   geographically targeted areas. Table 5 illustrates the importance of
   including climate change and environmental justice in the formulation
   of the geographically targeted affordable housing goals. Specifically,
   it shows the percentage distribution of GSE-purchased single-family
   home mortgage loans across areas that are highly exposed to
   climate-related natural disasters and environmental risks and hazards
   in current and proposed targeted underserved communities and in other
   income-based goals. If the proposed geographic location-based subgoals
   had been in effect for the past three years, a smaller percentage of
   loans would have been purchased by the GSEs in areas classified as
   minority census tracts (subgoal one) and low-income census tracts
   (subgoal two), which are characterized by a very high exposure to
   climate-related risks, high expected annual losses, high social
   vulnerability, and low community resilience. At the same time, the
   percentage of loans purchased in proposed location-based targets with
   high exposure to environmental hazards and risks and a high energy
   burden would have been larger than in current location- and
   income-based affordable housing goals. While reducing their activities
   in communities of color at high risk of natural disasters, the GSEs are
   likely to contribute to the long-standing disproportionate exposure of
   these communities to environmental hazards.

   These findings lead to an important policy prescription related to the
   GSEs' commitment to reducing the racial homeownership gap while
   addressing climate and environmental risks in communities of color.
   When promoting affordable homeownership in communities of color, it is
   critical that the GSEs not contribute to the already high exposure of
   these communities to environmental risks and make sure that communities
   of color at high risk of natural disasters are not left behind.

Policy recommendations

   To boost the FHFA's capacity to reduce the racial homeownership gap
   while simultaneously addressing climate change-related risks and
   systemic environmental racism reflected in the disproportionate
   vulnerability of communities of color to environmental hazards, CAP
   offers the following broad recommendations.

Include climate change and environmental justice considerations when setting
affordable housing goals, benchmarks, and criteria

   The FHFA should collect climate and environmental justice data to
   assess the risks posed by climate change and environmental hazards to
   communities of color. Race, climate, and environmental indicators
   should be a key component when formulating location-based affordable
   housing goals. Fine-tuning geographic targets would help the GSEs
   understand what specific activities enhance mitigation, promote
   equitably managed retreat from at-risk areas, and boost investment and
   climate resilience where they are needed the most. As this report has
   discussed, there are important variations in the exposure to climate
   and environmental risks for nonwhite racial and ethnic groups depending
   on the areas where they tend to be overrepresented. For example, while
   some groups are more exposed to hydrometeorological disasters, others
   are more vulnerable to climatological hazards. Furthermore, while some
   groups are more exposed to toxic facilities, others are more vulnerable
   to particulate matter, ozone, and other air pollutants that have
   deleterious public health consequences. Most importantly, the
   widespread, disproportionate proximity of communities of color to
   environmental hazards--due to decades of environmental racism--should
   be explicitly addressed to achieve environmental justice and make these
   communities more prepared and resilient in the event of natural
   disasters. Understanding variations in exposure to specific risks would
   provide guidance on the types of activities that should be
   incentivized.

Reorient market incentives in targeted communities to promote climate
resilience and access to affordable housing options in safer areas

   In addition to targeting communities of color that are vulnerable to
   climate change and environmental risks, the FHFA should prioritize the
   types of investment activities that reverse decades of environmental
   racism and promote economic stability, natural disaster risk
   mitigation, and climate resilience in underserved communities of color.
   This effort must be done without placing additional financial burdens
   on individual homeowners and communities. For instance, the FHFA should
   incentivize lenders and housing providers to encourage the development
   of energy-efficient and climate-resilient homes, including through
   electrification, solar power, and other sources of clean energy that
   reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Energy-efficient homes at high risk of
   heat waves would benefit vulnerable communities. In addition, new
   development and new mortgages in high-risk areas should be limited to
   reduce exposure to natural disasters, toxic facilities, and other
   environmental hazards. At the same time, the GSEs should ensure that
   communities of color have access to affordable homeownership in safer
   areas. To do so, the GSEs could enhance the availability of affordable
   homes in low-risk areas by offering incentives and resources, such as
   discounted rates for homes that are elevated or meet specific building
   and energy efficiency standards. Promoting the managed retreat of
   disadvantaged communities of color by steering them to low-risk areas
   is only possible if affordable and safe homeownership opportunities are
   available in those areas. At the same time, the GSEs should provide
   incentives in high-risk areas to foster physical adaptation and better
   protect homes.

Promote collaboration and alignment with other agencies

   The collection of climate data from multiple sources and coordination
   and consultations with other agencies and stakeholders is of paramount
   importance for assessing climate risk in communities of color, as well
   as for stress testing, scenario analysis, and geographic targeting. The
   FHFA should promote and support collaboration and alignment among
   different agencies in data collection and distribution, especially
   regarding the geographic targets defined for the affordable housing
   goals. The FHFA should align data-collection strategies and climate
   risk disclosure with the EPA,[241]^75 FEMA,[242]^76 NOAA, the U.S.
   Geological Survey, NASA, the financial regulators overseeing the
   Community Reinvestment Act,[243]^77 and the Council on Environmental
   Quality,[244]^78 as well as other sources of proprietary data such as
   the First Street Foundation,[245]^79 among others.

Improve the distribution of climate-related costs and protect borrowers of
color

   The GSEs should partner with the FHA to avoid shifting climate-related
   costs from the enterprises to HUD. For example, if the GSEs purchased
   the mortgages of borrowers of color in predominantly low-risk areas, a
   serious risk would arise for the FHA: It would unintentionally force
   the agency to bear the risks and costs associated with properties
   located in the more at-risk areas. In addition, the FHFA should spread
   climate risk across the enterprises' entire portfolio, rather than
   price it into individual loans, at the disadvantage of low- and
   moderate-income borrowers and borrowers of color who would otherwise
   continue to be priced out of areas at lower climate risk. At the same
   time, the FHFA should support fair lending and protect consumers from
   predatory and costly practices, possibly in collaboration with the
   Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.

Conclusion

   Decadeslong inequities in homeownership, the racial wealth gap, and
   exposure to climate risks and environmental hazards require a robust
   set of initiatives across the entire policy spectrum to achieve a just
   and equitable society. The GSEs are in a unique position to reduce the
   racial homeownership and wealth gaps in the nation while promoting
   climate resilience and environmental justice in communities of color
   without creating a modern form of redlining.[246]^80 They can do so by
   including climate risk and environmental justice considerations in the
   designation of underserved communities of color and by prioritizing the
   types of investment activities that reverse decades of environmental
   racism, promote economic stability, establish natural disaster risk
   mitigation, and create climate resilience in these communities.

       population do not reflect the socioeconomic heterogeneity of this

       selected groups indicate that the share of the nation's Indian,
       Japanese, Korean, and Taiwanese populations residing in low-income
       census tracts are much smaller than the share of other Asian
       groups, such as the nation's Vietnamese, Hmong, and Cambodian
       populations, among other groups that typically feature lower income
       levels and tend to be concentrated in low-income census tracts.

       received the lowest ratings and were deemed too risky to secure
       government-backed mortgages. Investment money was consistently
       deflected away from central cities where people of color were

       important heat-mitigating factor, are more likely to be found in
       parcels of owner-occupied housing. Because of decades of mortgage
       lending discrimination and limited access to homeownership,
       low-income communities of color have fewer trees and greater
       exposure to heat. See Nik Heynen, Harold A. Perkins, and Parama

       and Atmospheric Administration's National Centers for Environmental
       Information, the United States has experienced 323 weather and
       climate disasters with damages reaching or exceeding $1 billion
       from 1980 to 2021. In 2020 and 2021 alone, 42 severe disasters cost
       the nation a total of $257 billion in damages. See National Centers
       for Environmental Information, "Billion-Dollar Weather and Climate

       Lower-Income Households through Insurance."
   46. Ibid. The mandatory purchase requirement for flood insurance,
       established by the Flood Disaster Protection Act of 1973, still
       applies only to homeowners with federally backed mortgages residing
       in properties located in special flood hazard areas delineated by
       FEMA as part of the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP). These
       include loans purchased by the GSEs as well as loans guaranteed and
       insured by Federal Housing Administration, U.S. Department of
       Agriculture, and U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs. The
       Biggert-Waters Flood Insurance Reform Act of 2012 and the Homeowner
       Flood Insurance Affordability Act of 2014 made some changes to the
       original legislation. For instance, lenders are required to accept
       private flood insurance policies meeting specific criteria in order
       to satisfy the mandatory purchase requirement. See U.S. Government
       Accountability Office, "National Flood Insurance Program: Congress
       Should Consider Updating the Mandatory Purchase Requirement,"
       (Washington: 2021), available at
       [300]https://www.gao.gov/assets/gao-21-578.pdf. The Government
       Accountability Office (GAO) report indicates that noncompliance is
       an important challenge not just for the enterprises but for the
       U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development as well. The
       requirement to purchase and maintain flood insurance does not apply
       to all properties such as, for example, those located in a special
       flood hazard area but without a mortgage loan. Also, it does not
       apply to lenders that do not issue federally backed mortgage loans.
       According to the GAO, "Community participation in NFIP is
       voluntary. However, for a community's residents to purchase flood
       insurance through the program, the community must participate by
       agreeing to enforce regulations for land use, building standards,
       and new construction in special flood hazard areas. Participating
       communities must also adopt and enforce state and community flood
       plain management regulations to reduce future flood damage." U.S.
       Government Accountability Office, "National Flood Insurance
       Program: Congress Should Consider Updating the Mandatory Purchase
       Requirement," pp. 6-7. The NFIP program faces serious challenges,
       such as the large amount of debt due to insufficient premium rates.
       The program is insolvent after having paid out more than it
       collected for several years. See Colman and O'Donnell, "Borrowed
       time: Climate change threatens U.S. mortgage market." Since 2004,
       in particular, the NFIP has been unable to cover all claims with
       premiums it had collected and had to borrow funds from the U.S.
       Department of the Treasury. The NFIP's troubles were further
       exacerbated by the severity of major natural disasters such as
       Hurricane Katrina and Superstorm Sandy, which resulted in
       catastrophic losses.

Race in America 2019

Public has negative views of the country's racial progress; more than half
say Trump has made race relations worse

   By [90]Juliana Menasce Horowitz, [91]Anna Brown and [92]Kiana Cox
   (iStock photo)
   [93]Most black adults have negative views about the country's racial
   progress

   For updated findings on views about racial inequality in the U.S., see
   "[94]Amid National Reckoning, Americans Divided on Whether Increased
   Focus on Race Will Lead to Major Policy Change."

   More than 150 years after the 13th Amendment abolished slavery in the
   United States, most U.S. adults say the legacy of slavery continues to
   have an impact on the position of black people in American society
   today. More than four-in-ten say the country hasn't made enough
   progress toward racial equality, and there is some skepticism,
   particularly among blacks, that black people will ever have equal
   rights with whites, according to a new Pew Research Center survey.

   Opinions about the current state of race relations - and President
   Donald Trump's handling of the issue - are also negative. About
   six-in-ten Americans (58%) say race relations in the U.S. are bad, and
   of those, few see them improving. Some 56% think the president has made
   race relations worse; just 15% say he has improved race relations and
   another 13% say he has tried but failed to make progress on this issue.
   In addition, roughly two-thirds say it's become more common for people
   to express racist views since Trump became president.

   Blacks are particularly gloomy about the country's racial progress.
   More than eight-in-ten black adults say the legacy of slavery affects
   the position of black people in America today, including 59% who say it
   affects it a great deal. About eight-in-ten blacks (78%) say the
   country hasn't gone far enough when it comes to giving black people
   equal rights with whites, and fully half say it's unlikely that the
   country will eventually achieve racial equality.
   [95]Nonwhites are more likely to see advantages in being white

   Americans see disadvantages for blacks and Hispanics in the U.S. A
   majority of all adults (56%) say being black hurts people's ability to
   get ahead at least a little, and 51% say the same about being Hispanic.
   In contrast, 59% say being white helps people's ability to get ahead.
   Views about the impact of being Asian or Native American are more
   mixed.

   Blacks, Hispanics and Asians are more likely than whites to say being
   white helps people's ability to get ahead at least a little. Among
   whites, those who are more educated, as well as those who identify with
   or lean toward the Democratic Party, are particularly likely to see
   advantages to being white.

   The nationally representative survey of 6,637 adults was conducted
   online Jan. 22-Feb. 5, 2019, in English and Spanish, using Pew Research
   Center's [96]American Trends Panel.^[97]1 In addition to exploring the
   public's views about the state of race relations and racial inequality
   in America, the survey also looks at personal experiences with racial
   and ethnic discrimination and the role race plays in people's lives.
   Among the report's key findings:

Most Americans say it's now more common for people to express racist or
racially insensitive views; more than four-in-ten say it's more acceptable

   [98]Most say it's now more common for people to express racist or
   racially insensitive views

   Most Americans (65%) - including majorities across racial and ethnic
   groups - say it has become more common for people to express racist or
   racially insensitive views since Trump was elected president. A smaller
   but substantial share (45%) say this has become more acceptable.

   Democrats and those who lean Democratic are more likely than
   Republicans and Republican leaners to say it has become more common and
   more acceptable for people to express racist and racially insensitive
   views since Trump was elected president. Among Democrats, 84% say this
   is now more common and 64% say it's more acceptable; fewer than half of
   Republicans say it has become more common (42%) and just 22% say it has
   become more acceptable for people to express these types of views.

Views of Trump's handling of race relations are far more negative than views
of how Obama handled the issue

   [99]A majority of U.S. adults say Trump has made race relations worse

   A majority of Americans (56%) say Trump has made race relations worse;
   just 15% say he has made progress toward improving race relations,
   while 13% say he has tried but failed to make progress and 14% say he
   hasn't addressed this issue. In contrast, 37% say Barack Obama made
   progress on race relations when he was president, and 27% say he tried
   but failed.^[100]2 A quarter of Americans say Obama made race relations
   worse. These retrospective views of Obama's handling of race relations
   are nearly identical to views expressed [101]during Obama's last year
   in office.

   Not surprisingly, assessments of Trump's and Obama's handling of race
   relations differ considerably along partisan lines. Democrats
   overwhelmingly say Trump has made race relations worse (84%), including
   large shares of black (79%) and white (86%) Democrats. Views are more
   divided among Republicans. About a third of Republicans (34%) say Trump
   has improved race relations and 25% say he has tried but failed to make
   progress; 19% of Republicans say he hasn't addressed the issue, while
   20% say he has made race relations worse.

   When it comes to views of Obama's handling of race relations, 55% of
   Democrats say he improved race relations during his presidency; just 8%
   say he made things worse. In contrast, 51% of Republicans say Obama
   made race relations worse, while 14% say he made progress toward
   improving it. As is the case with views of Trump's handling of race
   relations, white and black Democrats offer somewhat similar assessments
   of how Obama handled this issue when he was president.

Republicans and Democrats have vastly different views on race

   [102]White Republicans, white Democrats differ widely in their views of
   the country's racial progress

   In addition to being linked to views of Trump's handling of race
   relations, partisanship is strongly associated with racial attitudes
   more broadly. In fact, after controlling for other factors,
   partisanship has a greater association with views about the country's
   racial progress than demographic factors, though being young and more
   educated are also significant predictors, particularly among
   whites.^[103]3

   Because whites and nonwhites often have widely different views of
   racial issues, and nonwhites disproportionately identify with or lean
   to the Democratic Party, gaps between Republicans and Democrats are
   often shown among whites in this report in order to account for
   differences in the racial composition of the two parties.^[104]4

   White Democrats (64%) are far more likely than white Republicans (15%)
   to say the country hasn't gone far enough when it comes to giving black
   people equal rights with whites. About half of Republicans say it's
   been about right, while a sizable minority (31%) says the country has
   gone too far in this regard.

   Eight-in-ten white Democrats - vs. 40% of white Republicans - say the
   legacy of slavery continues to have an impact on black people's
   position in American society today. And when it comes to views about
   racialdiscrimination, 78% of white Democrats say the bigger problem is
   people not seeing it where it really does exist, while a similar share
   of white Republicans say people seeing racialdiscrimination where it
   really does not exist is the bigger problem.

Blacks are more likely than other groups to say their race has had a negative
impact on their ability to get ahead; whites are the most likely to say their
race helped them

   [105]About half of blacks say being black has hurt their ability to get
   ahead

   About half of black adults (52%) say being black has hurt their ability
   to get ahead at least a little, with 18% saying it has hurt a lot.
   About a quarter of Hispanics and Asians (24% each) and just 5% of
   whites say their race or ethnicity has had a negative impact. In turn,
   whites are more likely than other groups to say their racial background
   has helped them at least a little.

   Among blacks, those with at least some college experience are more
   likely than those with less education to say being black has hurt their
   ability to get ahead.

   Education is also linked with whites' perceptions of the impact their
   race has had on their ability to get ahead. Small shares of whites
   across educational levels say their racial background has hurt their
   ability to succeed, but those with a bachelor's degree are more likely
   than those with less education to say being white helped them at least
   a little.

   Across all racial and ethnic groups, more point to their own hard work
   than to any other attribute, including their race, their gender, the
   people they know or their family's financial situation, as something
   that helped them get ahead.

Blacks, whites differ in assessments of why it may be harder for black people
to get ahead

   [106]Blacks are far more likely than whites to say discrimination is a
   major obstacle for black people

   Whether or not they see their race as an obstacle for them personally,
   about two-thirds of blacks (68%) say being black generally hurts a
   person's ability to get ahead in the country; 55% of whites say the
   same.

   Among those who say being black hurts a person's ability to get ahead,
   blacks are far more likely than whites to point to racial
   discrimination, less access to high-paying jobs and less access to good
   schools as major reasons why this is the case. In turn, whites are more
   likely than blacks to point to family instability and lack of good role
   models as major obstacles for black people. The same shares in both
   groups (22%) say a lack of motivation to work hard is to blame.

   There are wide partisan gaps in these views. Most white Democrats who
   say being black hurts a person's ability to succeed point to racial
   discrimination (70%) and less access to good schools (75%) or
   high-paying jobs (64%) as major reasons for this (among black
   Democrats, the shares are 86%, 74% and 78%, respectively). By
   comparison, about a third or fewer white Republicans say these are
   major obstacles for blacks. White Republicans are more likely than
   white Democrats to cite family instability, lack of good role models
   and a lack of motivation to work hard.

Majorities of black and white adults say blacks are treated less fairly than
whites in dealing with police and by the criminal justice system

   [107]Whites and blacks differ widely in views of how blacks are treated

   Black and white adults have widely different perceptions of how blacks
   are treated in America, but majorities of both groups say blacks are
   treated less fairly than whites by the criminal justice system (87% of
   blacks vs. 61% of whites) and in dealing with police (84% vs. 63%,
   respectively).

   About six-in-ten blacks or more - but fewer than half of whites - say
   blacks are treated less fairly than whites in hiring, pay and
   promotions; when applying for a loan or mortgage; in stores or
   restaurants; when voting in elections; and when seeking medical
   treatment. In each of these realms, whites tend to say blacks and
   whites are treated about equally; very small shares say whites are
   treated less fairly than blacks.

   Across these different areas, there are gaps ranging from 39 to 53
   percentage points in how white Democrats and white Republicans see the
   treatment of blacks in the U.S. About half or more white Democrats say
   blacks are treated less fairly than whites in dealing with the police
   (88% vs. 43% of white Republicans); by the criminal justice system (86%
   vs. 39%); in hiring, pay and promotions (72% vs. 21%); when applying
   for a mortgage or loan (64% vs. 17%); in stores or restaurants (62% vs.
   16%); when voting in elections (60% vs. 7%); and when seeking medical
   treatment (48% vs. 9%).

   In some of these areas, black and white Democrats express similar
   views, but larger shares of black Democrats say black people are
   treated less fairly than whites in employment situations (86%), when
   applying for a loan or mortgage (78%), in stores or restaurants (73%),
   and when seeking medical treatment (61%).

Most Americans, including similar shares of whites and blacks, say it's never
acceptable for a white person to use the N-word

   [108]Black and white adults have similar views on use of the N-word

   Seven-in-ten U.S. adults say they, personally, think it's never
   acceptable for a white person to use the N-word; 13% say this is rarely
   acceptable and about one-in-ten say it is always (3%) or sometimes (6%)
   acceptable for a white person to use the N-word. Roughly seven-in-ten
   whites and blacks say this is never acceptable.

   A smaller share of Hispanics (58%) say it's never acceptable for a
   white person to use the N-word, but this is driven in part by the
   relatively large share of foreign-born Hispanics (28%) who say they are
   not sure whether it's acceptable for a white person to use the N-word.
   Among Hispanics born in the U.S., 67% say this is never acceptable.

   When it comes to black people using the N-word, about four-in-ten
   adults - including similar shares of blacks and whites - say they,
   personally, think it is never acceptable; 15% say it is rarely
   acceptable and about a third say it's always (13%) or sometimes (20%)
   acceptable for black people to use the N-word.

Most black adults say being black is extremely or very important to how they
think about themselves

   [109]Blacks are more likely than other groups to see their race or
   ethnicity as central to their identity

   Blacks are more likely than Hispanics or Asians - and much more likely
   than whites - to say that their race is central to their identity.
   About three-quarters of black adults say being black is extremely (52%)
   or very (22%) important to how they think of themselves; 59% of
   Hispanics and 56% of Asians say being Hispanic or Asian, respectively,
   is at least very important to their overall identity, with about
   three-in-ten in each group saying it's extremely important. In
   contrast, just 15% of whites say being white is very or extremely
   important to how they think of themselves; about two-thirds say it's
   either only a little important (18%) or not important at all (47%).

   Whites and blacks younger than 30 are less likely than their older
   counterparts to say their race is at least very important to their
   overall identity. Some 64% of black adults ages 18 to 29 say being
   black is at least very important, compared with roughly three-quarters
   or more among older age groups. And while relatively few whites across
   age groups say being white is central to how they think about
   themselves, whites younger than 30 are among the least likely to say
   so.

   Among Hispanics, those born abroad are more likely than those born in
   the U.S. to say being Hispanic is at least very important to how they
   think of themselves (65% vs. 52%).

Majorities of blacks, Hispanics and Asians say they have experienced
discrimination because of their race or ethnicity

   About three-quarters of blacks and Asians (76% of each) - and 58% of
   Hispanics - say they have experienced discrimination or have been
   treated unfairly because of their race or ethnicity at least from time
   to time. In contrast, about two-thirds of whites (67%) say they've
   never experienced this.

   When asked about specific situations they may have experienced because
   of their race or ethnicity, blacks are considerably more likely than
   whites, Hispanics or Asians to say that people have acted as if they
   were suspicious of them; people have acted as if they thought they
   weren't smart; they have been treated unfairly by an employer in
   hiring, pay or promotion; or they have been unfairly stopped by police.
   Hispanics and Asians are more likely than whites to say each of these
   have happened to them.

   Asians are more likely than any other group to say they have been
   subject to slurs or jokes because of their race or ethnicity. In turn,
   more whites than blacks, Hispanics or Asians say people have assumed
   they were prejudiced or racist; 45% of whites have had this experience.
   [110]Most blacks say someone has acted suspicious of them or as if they
   weren't smart

For Hispanics, skin color is associated with experiences with discrimination

   The survey asked black and Hispanic respondents to identify the skin
   tone that best resembles their own using a modified version of the
   [111]Massey-Martin scale.^[112]5 A multivariate analysis suggests that
   Hispanics with darker skin tones are more likely than those with
   lighter skin to say they have ever experienced discrimination or been
   treated unfairly because of their race or ethnicity.^[113]6 Darker skin
   color is also associated with a higher likelihood among Hispanics of
   saying that - because of their race or ethnicity - people have acted as
   if they were suspicious of them, people have acted as if they thought
   they weren't smart, they have been treated unfairly in employment
   situations, they have subject to slurs or jokes, and that they have
   feared for their safety.

   Among blacks, those with darker skin tones are more likely to say they
   have experienced racialdiscrimination generally, but skin color is not
   necessarily associated with having faced specific situations because of
   their race or ethnicity. In fact, for blacks, being male and having
   higher levels of education are more consistently associated with the
   specific forms of discrimination asked about in the survey.
   A note about the Asian sample
   (BUTTON)

   This survey includes an oversample of Asian respondents, for a total
   sample size of 332 Asians. The sample includes English-speaking Asians
   only and, therefore, may not be representative of the overall U.S.
   Asian population (66% of our weighted Asian sample was born in another
   country, compared with 78% of the U.S. Asian adult population overall).

   Despite this limitation, it is important to report the views of Asians
   on race relations and racial inequality, as well as their personal
   experiences with racialdiscrimination, as the U.S. Asian population is
   [114]growing faster than any other major racial or ethnic group.
   Measuring the attitudes of Asians on these topics is an important piece
   in understanding the state of race in America today.

   As always, Asians' responses are incorporated into the general
   population figures throughout this report; data are weighted to be
   representative of the U.S. adult population as a whole. Asians are
   shown as a separate group when the question was asked of the full
   sample. Because of the relatively small sample size and a reduction in
   precision due to weighting, results are not shown separately for Asians
   for questions that were only asked of a random half of respondents
   (Form 1/Form 2) or some filtered questions. We are also not able to
   analyze Asian respondents by demographic categories, such as gender,
   age or education.
   Terminology
   (BUTTON)

   References to whites, blacks and Asians include only those who are
   non-Hispanic and identify as only one race. Hispanics are of any race.

   All references to party affiliation include those who lean toward that
   party: Republicans include those who identify as Republicans and
   independents who say they lean toward the Republican Party, and
   Democrats include those who identify as Democrats and independents who
   say they lean toward the Democratic Party.

   References to college graduates or people with a college degree
   comprise those with a bachelor's degree or more. "Some college"
   includes those with an associate degree and those who attended college
   but did not obtain a degree. "High school" refers to those who have a
   high school diploma or its equivalent, such as a General Education
   Development (GED) certificate.

   Foreign born refers to people born outside of the United States, Puerto
   Rico or other U.S. territories to parents neither of whom was a U.S.
   citizen, regardless of legal status.

   U.S. born refers to individuals who are U.S. citizens at birth,
   including people born in the United States, Puerto Rico or other U.S.
   territories, as well as those born elsewhere to parents who were U.S.
   citizens.

   This report has been corrected to address an error in the
   classification of Asian respondents. In this corrected report, Asian
   estimates are based on 332 respondents who self-identified as Asian or
   Asian American only. An earlier version of this report provided Asian
   estimates based on 355 respondents, which properly included the 332
   single-race Asian respondents but also included 23 respondents who
   identified as Native Hawaiian or other Pacific Islander or both Asian
   and Native Hawaiian or other Pacific Islander. This correction did not
   affect any of the substantive conclusions of the study. Some estimates
   for Asians changed by 1 to 3 percentage points.

       For more details, see the [122]Methodology section of the report.
       [123]&#8617;
    2. The question on Trump's handling of race relations was asked on
       both telephone and online surveys in 2019 and no significant
       [124]mode differences were found. The numbers reported here are
       from the online survey. The retrospective question on Obama's
       handling of race relations was asked only on a phone survey in 2019
       and is compared with a 2016 phone survey. [125]&#8617;
    3. This analysis is based on a series of logistic regressions and
       includes measures of partisanship, race, age, education and gender.
       [126]&#8617;
    4. There aren't enough black or Asian Republicans in the sample to
       compare the views of these groups across parties. While there is
       some evidence of party differences among Hispanics, there aren't
       enough Hispanic Republicans to analyze on some questions that were
       not asked of the full sample. [127]&#8617;
    5. The skin tone scale developed by Douglas S. Massey and Jennifer A.
       Martin and used by many social scientists is an 11-point scale
       ranging from 0 (total absence of color) to 10 (darkest possible
       skin). This survey used a 5-point scale. See survey [128]topline
       for the images used. [129]&#8617;
    6. This analysis is based on a series of logistic regressions. In
       addition to skin tone, the regression models also controlled for
       respondents' gender, age, education and region of the country. For
       Hispanics, the models also included whether they were born in the
       U.S. or in another country. [130]&#8617;

UN Report: US fails to implement terms of treaty on eliminating racial
discrimination

   September 09, 2022
   [62]Lisa Borden
   [63]Lisa Borden
   Senior Policy Counsel for International Advocacy

   A United Nations committee that is reviewing U.S. compliance with an
   international treaty on racialdiscrimination has issued findings that
   should be seen as a serious rebuke and wakeup call for the Biden
   administration.

   The final report of the U.N. Committee on the Elimination of Racial
   Discrimination ([64]CERD), issued on Aug. 30, criticized the systemic
   and longstanding failure of the U.S. to take compliance with the treaty
   seriously and to develop mechanisms to integrate its goals into
   domestic policy.

   In its [65]concluding observations and recommendations regarding the
   U.S., the committee raised significant concerns about compliance with
   nearly every aspect of the [66]International Convention on the
   Elimination of All Forms of racialdiscrimination.

   Especially noteworthy was CERD's focus on issues contained in specific
   recommendations that the Southern Poverty Law Center submitted to the
   committee earlier in August. These issues included hate and extremism
   as well as racial disparities in voting, health care, education, the
   criminal legal system and immigration.

   The SPLC [67]went to Geneva, Switzerland, as part of a coalition of
   more than 70 advocates from U.S.-based nongovernmental organizations
   (NGOs), to provide documentation to CERD of ongoing racial
   discrimination and disparities in the U.S. We submitted [68]three
   reports in advance of the review and traveled with a [69]delegation
   that included two formerly incarcerated people who shared their
   experiences with committee members.

   We're pleased that CERD embraced many of our policy recommendations on
   the issues we raised. We will now work with coalition partners to urge
   the Biden administration to translate those recommendations into
   concrete policy changes.

   At the same time, it's deeply troubling that the U.S. has not done more
   to implement the treaty, the oldest of nine core international human
   rights accords. The U.S. has ratified only three of the nine. The U.S.
   signed the treaty on racialdiscrimination in 1966 but did not ratify
   it until 1994.

General failure to implement the treaty

   At the outset, the committee reiterated concerns it had expressed in
   past reviews about the continued failure of the U.S. to incorporate the
   treaty into domestic law and policy, specifically mentioning its
   notable absence from President Joe Biden's [70]Executive Order on
   Advancing Racial Equity and Support for Underserved Communities Through
   the Federal Government.

   The SPLC has repeatedly raised this issue, not only in our reports to
   CERD but also directly to various U.S. officials.

   Even though the U.S. has signed and ratified the treaty, Congress has
   never taken any steps to incorporate its requirements into U.S.
   legislation, and no administration has made an effort to do the same
   when developing and implementing domestic policy. This means that the
   treaty is in force on paper, but any instance of compliance with its
   requirements is merely coincidental.

   The committee also regretted the continued failure of the United States
   to create a national human rights institution (NHRI) or any similar
   coordinating mechanism to monitor implementation of the treaty.
   Additionally, the committee lamented the continued absence of a
   comprehensive national action plan to combat systemic racism and
   structural discrimination. It urged the U.S. to proceed on both fronts.

   The U.S. has long declined to establish any federal mechanism to
   coordinate and monitor implementation of any of its international human
   rights treaty obligations, claiming that agency-level oversight of
   related domestic laws and regulations is sufficient. That claim is
   clearly mistaken, given the results of CERD's review and the failure of
   the federal government to even consider these treaties when fashioning
   domestic policy.

   Notably, a White House representative who was part of the president's
   Geneva delegation told the committee during the review that the
   administration would consider proceeding with a study of how best to
   create an NHRI - a welcome departure from the intentions expressed by
   the administration during pre-review consultations, when the same
   person told NGO representatives that there were no plans to pursue
   this.

   The committee also recommended that the U.S. consult with NGOs
   regarding the creation and implementation of a national action plan to
   combat systemic racism and structural discrimination.

Hate and extremism

   Unique among the nations, hate speech in the United States is broadly
   protected by the First Amendment.

   The committee raised its perennial concerns about this and recommended
   action to confront the prevalence of hate speech, including by public
   officials and politicians, and to establish mechanisms to collect data
   on hate incidents (something the SPLC has supported).

   The committee also raised concerns about the increased activity of
   white supremacists and violent extremist groups. While recognizing the
   important progress made by the enactment of the [71]COVID-19 Hate
   Crimes Act (legislation that authorizes incentive grants to spark
   improved local and state hate crime training, prevention, best
   practices and data collection initiatives), the committee echoed SPLC
   concerns about consistent underreporting of hate crimes and recommended
   establishing a comprehensive data collection system that is either
   mandatory or that conditions federal funding on credible participation
   - a recommendation we had made to the committee in our submission.

   The SPLC's recommendations in this arena likely contributed to the
   committee's own, unusually strong and specific proposals for action.
   What's more, the committee recommended mandatory hate crime training
   for all law enforcement officials.

Voting rights

   Threats to voting rights are a major source of concern for the SPLC and
   have been the focus of several of our submissions to international
   human rights bodies, including CERD.

   The committee expressed concerns about the prevalence of state voter
   suppression laws and provided a laundry list of specific suppression
   measures that need attention, all of which had been addressed in our
   report. It recommended restoring the Voting Rights Act and taking other
   measures, including federal legislation, to eliminate unreasonable
   restrictions on the right to vote.

   Echoing concerns that were also addressed in a statement by our
   community partner [72]Page Dukes, a member of the SPLC delegation, the
   committee specifically recommended steps to ensure that people
   convicted of felonies have their voting rights restored upon completion
   of their incarceration and that the federal government review state
   laws that provide for the automatic disenfranchisement of those who are
   incarcerated.

Prisons

   The committee raised concerns about the continued overrepresentation of
   racial and ethnic minorities in the prison population and specifically
   about their being disproportionately held in solitary confinement for
   long periods of time. SPLC community partner [73]Terrance Winn, also a
   member of the SPLC delegation, told the committee of being locked up in
   solitary confinement numerous times at Angola prison in Louisiana
   during his 30-year incarceration.

   Further reflecting Winn's testimony, the committee raised concerns
   about prison labor practices, especially the lack of adequate pay and
   other labor protections.

   It also addressed the disproportionate impact of collateral
   consequences including housing, employment and access to government
   benefits, and expressed concerns about the prosecution of juveniles in
   adult courts. The committee recommended strict limitations on the use
   of solitary confinement in line with the U.N.'s [74]Mandela Rules,
   which provide standards for the treatment of incarcerated people, and
   urged full compliance with the Mandela Rules on prison labor.

Health care

   In alignment with our submission on racial disparities in health care,
   the committee expressed concerns about lack of access to adequate
   health care in states that did not expand Medicaid, recommending
   expanded coverage programs to ensure that everyone has such access.

   Our submission to the committee on health care disparities also
   included information on racially disparate maternal and infant
   mortality rates and the impact that the Supreme Court's [75]Dobbs
   decision and state abortion restrictions will have on health and health
   care in the Deep South states where we work. We were pleased to see
   that that the committee raised the same concerns and urged measures to
   combat the racially disproportionate impact of these issues.

Immigration

   On migration issues, the committee expressed concerns about mandatory
   detention and detention conditions, including the lack of access to
   counsel, violence against undocumented migrants by immigration
   enforcement officers and disparate treatment of Black and Brown
   migrants.

   It recommended ending mandatory detention and criminal prosecution for
   illegal entry and ensuring due process and access to counsel. The
   committee also raised concerns about impunity for abuses against
   migrants by U.S. immigration enforcement officers and recommended that
   the U.S. undertake measures to prevent and to properly investigate and
   provide accountability for improper uses of force.

Education

   As reflected in the SPLC's submission, the committee stated concerns
   about state-level measures to prohibit school instruction about race,
   discrimination, privilege and oppression, and about book banning and
   intimidation of teachers and school administrators. It recommended that
   the U.S. take all measures necessary to ensure that human rights
   education, including race discrimination and the history of slavery and
   colonialism, is part of all school curricula, and to afford adequate
   protections for educators from harassment, intimidation and violence.

   In addition, the committee echoed the concerns raised in our
   recommendations about education funding disparities and private school
   voucher programs that are exacerbating racial segregation in schools
   around the country.

   It was also concerned about racially disproportionate school discipline
   and policing.

   The committee recommended development of a comprehensive national plan
   on socioeconomic and racial school segregation, along with measures to
   pressure states to address funding disparities and to combat school
   discipline and juvenile justice disparities.

What comes next

   Following the review, the committee recommended that the U.S. continue,
   and increase, its consultations with civil society organizations such
   as the SPLC and other human rights-oriented NGOs.

   The SPLC and other NGOs will press the administration to begin this
   process quickly and to ensure that it is much more substantive than it
   has been in the past.

   As part of the review process, the committee identified some of its
   recommendations - involving maternal and reproductive health, the
   rights of Indigenous people and the rights of migrants - to be the
   subject of follow-up reporting by the U.S. in one year.

   Given the dire threats to voting rights and the urgency of addressing
   them, we had hoped that voting rights would be a part of the one-year
   follow-up. But it's difficult to decide which fires should be
   extinguished first, and these are all vitally important issues.

   The next regular periodic report, which will begin the review process
   again, is to be submitted by Nov. 20, 2025. Until then, there is much
   to be done to begin the long overdue process of meaningful
   implementation of the treaty.

   Elimination of All Forms of racialdiscrimination in 1966, the U.S. has
   failed to incorporate the treaty's requirements into domestic policy,

For equality, respect and dignity we must `speak as one' against racism:
Guterres

   18 March 2022 [69]Human Rights

   Racism continues to poison institutions, social structures, and
   everyday life across all societies, the UN chief said on Friday at a
   dedicated meeting against what he referred to as a catalyst that
   "normalizes hate, denies dignity, and spurs violence".

   "It continues to be a driver of persistent inequality...to deny people
   their fundamental human rights", added [70]Secretary-General Ant?nio
   Guterres in [71]an address to the General Assembly, marking the
   [72]International Day for the Elimination of racialdiscrimination.

   Racism continues to poison institutions, social structures &amp;
   everyday life in every society.Realizing the vision of a world free of
   racism &amp; racialdiscrimination demands action every day, at every
   level, in every society. pic.twitter.com/IK12F99X47
   Ant?nio Guterres, UN Secretary-General
   antonioguterres

   He argued that racism destabilizes communities worldwide, "undermines
   democracies, erodes the legitimacy of governments, and stymies an
   inclusive and sustainable recovery from [73]COVID-19."

   Commemorated annually on 21 March, he described the day as "both a day
   of recognition and an urgent call to action".

Unequivocal links

   The top UN official drew attention to the links between racism and
   gender inequality, pointing to overlapping and intersecting
   discrimination suffered by women of colour and minority groups.

   Moreover, he continued, "no country is immune from intolerance, nor
   free of hate."

   "Africans and people of African descent, Asians and people of Asian
   descent, minority communities, indigenous peoples, migrants, refugees,
   and so many others - all continue to confront stigmatization,
   scapegoating, discrimination, and violence".

`Bedrock' of societies

   This year's theme - "Voices for Action against Racism" - calls on
   everyone to listen closely, speak out loudly, and act decisively.

   "We all have a responsibility to engage in solidarity with movements
   for equality and human rights everywhere. And we must extend solidarity
   to everyone fleeing conflict," said the UN chief, urging the world to
   "speak out against hate speech - offline and online."

   He upheld the need to defend civic space by protecting free expression
   and assembly, describing it is "the bedrock of pluralist, peaceful and
   inclusive societies".

`Dismantle discriminatory structures'

   Mr. Guterres called for a rights-based social contract "to tackle
   poverty and exclusion, invest in education, and rebuild trust and
   social cohesion."

   "We must listen to those experiencing injustice and ensure their
   concerns and demands are at the centre of efforts to dismantle
   discriminatory structures," he insisted.

   He made a case for "reparatory justice" to realize racial equality and
   atone in a substantive way for centuries of enslavement and
   colonialism.

   "Historical injustices manifest themselves in poverty,
   underdevelopment, marginalization, and social instability for entire
   communities and countries," he reminded. "It is time to recognize and
   repair longstanding wrongs".

     It is time to recognize and repair longstanding wrongs -- UN chief

Repairing the past

   A just future, requires mending a discriminatory past, in line with
   international human rights obligations and commitments, he said.

   The UN chief encouraged States to accelerate racial justice and
   equality through the [74]Durban Declaration and Programme of Action;
   the[75] International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of
   racialdiscrimination; the [76]Agenda Towards Transformative Change for
   Racial Justice and Equality; and the [77]UN's Permanent Forum of People
   of African Descent.

   He called for concrete action through policies, legislation, and "more
   granular data collection" to support efforts at national and global
   levels.

   The UN has launched its own internal strategic action plan on
   addressing racism, he reminded, that outlines concrete measures to
   tackle racism in the workplace through accountability - for which a
   Special Adviser and Steering Group are due to be appointed.
   Stop Racism

   "Together, we are committed to making sure people of every race,
   ethnicity, colour, gender, religion, creed and sexual orientation,
   enjoy a sense of belonging and safety, and have an equal opportunity to
   contribute to the success of our United Nations," he stated

   Action every day, at every level, in every society is demanded to
   achieve a world free of racism and racialdiscrimination.
   "Let us unite around our common humanity and speak as one for equality,
   respect, justice and dignity for all," concluded the UN chief.

Paying tribute to Ukraine

   Hosting the event, General Assembly President Abdulla Shahid, began by
   [78]expressing his "deepest concerns" over the violence waged against
   civilians, and particularly women and girls, in Ukraine.

   As families continue to seek refuge and security in new locations, he
   said, "our thoughts are with the people of Ukraine."

A goal not realized

   Since the day was established more than half a century ago, the
   elimination of racialdiscrimination has continued to elude us, Mr.
   Shahid reminded the participants.

   Despite that the International Convention has reached near universal
   ratification, he observed, "we continue to see an increase in hate
   speech, intolerance, and racism, especially against minorities."

   "Our moral failure to eliminate racialdiscrimination is a failure
   against everything we stand for in the Hall of this Assembly", he
   declared.

`Overt stereotyping'

   The Assembly President drew attention to the long-lasting consequences
   of racialdiscrimination, noting that the COVID pandemic has served to
   exacerbate underlying and long-standing inequalities that plague
   societies at large, including racism, racialdiscrimination,
   xenophobia, and other forms of intolerance.

   Many marginalized and vulnerable people have lost decades of precious
   gains, especially in their social, economic, civil, and political
   lives, he said.

     We have a moral obligation to tackle racism in all its forms -- UN
     Assembly President

   "Let me be clear: racialdiscrimination is an overt stereotyping and
   prejudice that arises from hate speech and hate propaganda," Mr. Shahid
   spelled out.

A moral obligation

   Rather than acknowledging the beauty of diversity, he maintained that
   racism gives birth to violence and strengthens inequalities.

   "We can and we must do better," said the Assembly president. "We have a
   moral obligation to tackle racism in all its forms."

   Going forward, he encouraged national governments, civil society
   organizations, and the private sector to "work together to eliminate
   racialdiscrimination."

Can you tackle systemic racism without confronting race?

   A century-old debate over `colorblind' remedies for racial
   discrimination continues today.

   It's not a question of simple semantics. Words exercise power and
   consequences.

   In the governmental jargon that can turn rhetoric into reality, two
   words -- "disadvantaged" and "underserved" -- help to explain why one
   act of Congress failed to provide long sought financial assistance to
   Black farmers, but another may succeed.

   The [90]American Rescue Plan Act, a bipartisan measure signed into law
   last year by President Joe Biden, set aside $4 billion for farmers
   considered socially disadvantaged.

   "A socially disadvantaged group," according to U.S. Department of
   Agriculture [91]policy guidelines, "is a group whose members have been
   subject to racial or ethnic prejudice because of their identity as
   members of a group without regard to their individual qualities." They
   include African Americans, American Indians, Alaskan Natives, Asians,
   Hispanics, Native Hawaiians and Pacific Islanders.

   Within weeks, white farmers argued that it was unconstitutional for the
   $1.9 trillion rescue plan to authorize appropriations that excluded
   farmers based on their race or ethnicity. A federal judge in Florida
   later agreed and blocked implementation of the aid to farmers of color
   on grounds that it discriminated against white farmers.

   The U.S. has long been caught in a tug of war over whether race can be
   used as a remedy for racialdiscrimination. The U.S. Supreme Court,
   which has historically interpreted the Constitution to prohibit many
   race-specific measures, will hear oral arguments this fall in cases
   against Harvard University and the University of North Carolina at
   Chapel Hill on whether colleges and universities can consider students'
   race and ethnicity in admissions.

   On his first day in office, Biden issued an executive order to advance
   racial equity across the federal government. The USDA program to cancel
   certain loan debts held by socially disadvantaged farmers was
   considered an important early step toward fulfilling that promise. But
   legal challenges prevented the program from taking effect.

   IFRAME: [92]https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/NItoD/3/

   Then the $738 billion [93]Inflation Reduction Act, passed on a sharply
   partisan vote and signed into law in August, presented a solution. It
   amends a section of the previous bill from benefiting "socially
   disadvantaged farmers" to "underserved farmers," a broader category
   that can include veterans, beginning farmers and those in high poverty
   areas. Included in that section is $2.2 billion for farmers who can
   [94]prove they experienced discrimination from the USDA.

   It separately appropriates another $3.1 billion for all borrowers who
   are behind on loan payments or face other financial risks. This week,
   USDA announced that it has distributed nearly $800 million under the
   program to more than 13,000 distressed borrowers, with plans to provide
   up to $500 million more to as many as 23,000 additional borrowers.

   And it repeals the debt cancellation program in the American Rescue
   Plan Act.

   "We need to be clear about this. The Inflation Reduction Act, and the
   work that Congress did, charts a new pathway and a new set of tools for
   USDA to have," USDA Secretary Tom Vilsack said on a call with reporters
   this week. "These tools are available to USDA borrowers regardless of
   race or gender or geography or size of operation or type of operation."

   But the new measure has prompted legal challenge - this time, from
   Black farmers and other farmers of color.

   A class-action lawsuit filed this month alleges that the U.S.
   government broke its contract with the farmers when it agreed to cancel
   their loan debts, while in return the farmers accepted the government's
   calculation of their debt and waived their right to appeal. The farmers
   were harmed because they made purchases and other investments in
   anticipation of the financial relief, according to the [95]suit brought
   by civil rights attorney Ben Crump and others.

   Some Black farmers and their advocates have been skeptical,
   disappointed and frustrated because the Inflation Reduction Act does
   not directly address what they consider race-based difficulties, such
   as lower rates of loan approval and higher rates of delinquency.

   Others, however, are hopeful that the overall assistance to farmers of
   color will be equal to or perhaps even greater than it would have been
   under the previous bill.

   As it turned out, far fewer Black farmers were eligible to have their
   loans canceled under the American Rescue Plan provision than Black
   farmer advocates had initially estimated. About 3,100 Black farmers
   would have qualified, and their combined debt from those loans was less
   than $300 million, U.S. Rep. Alma Adams, D-N.C., vice chair of the
   House Agriculture Committee, noted in a July letter to Secretary
   Vilsack.

   That meant most Black farmers would have been left out. Overlooked is
   that "USDA is not providing loans to Blacks," said Lloyd Wright, a
   former director of the USDA's Office of Civil Rights., Wright is among
   those hopeful that far more Black farmers will receive financial
   assistance from the two provisions in the Inflation Reduction Act than
   they would have through the previous bill, although he worries about
   whether implementation will bear this out.

   In a broader context, though, the situation illustrates the difficult
   dilemma for efforts to address racial disparities. How can you
   ameliorate racialdiscrimination without spelling out its causes and
   effects?

   "It's like saying you want to address gender issues, but you can't do
   anything that specifically focuses on women," Ralph Richard Banks,
   faculty director of the Stanford Center for Racial Justice at Stanford
   Law School, said in a recent interview.

   "In our society," he said, "the legal norms are kind of opposed to
   focusing on race, per se. We want to have racial equality, equity and
   justice, and all this, but we don't want to single race out or treat
   people differently on account of race, and that does make it difficult
   to address race-based inequities if we don't take race into account
   directly."

A system that discriminates

   Cash flow is critical in the business of farming, where short- and
   long-term income and essential operating revenues can be determined
   more by the whims of Mother Nature than the desires of customers and
   abilities of farmers. The financial difficulties of one year can easily
   pass into the next, and this generation's hardships can become those of
   the next generation as well.

   That makes loans essential to commercial farmers, and timely repayment
   of those loans more vulnerable to major disruptions in the economy,
   such as those related to the COVID-19 pandemic and the historic
   increases in the rate of inflation.

   Black farmers and their advocates contend that over the years they have
   received less than their fair share of assistance through the USDA
   program that provides low-interest direct loans for activities such as
   purchasing land, crops, livestock and equipment.

   That imbalance is ongoing, they say.

   "We are in a system that's systematically biased and racist against
   those farmers," said Kara Boyd, president of the Association of
   American Indian Farmers and a member of the National Black Farmers
   Association, led by her husband, John. The Boyds and two other Virginia
   farmers are the named plaintiffs in the class-action lawsuit.

   Advocates say that the current economic hardships help explain the
   racial differences in loan delinquency the Center for Public Integrity
   found in 2022 USDA data.

   "Unfortunately, some of the farmers who were struggling before, now,
   they're struggling even more because of the repeal of the act," Boyd
   said.

   But on the call with reporters Tuesday, Secretary Vilsack pointed to
   the $2.2 billion provision for farmers who feel that they have been
   unfairly treated in the past by the USDA. The department is currently
   seeking input on how to design and structure the program, which will be
   administered by one or more third parties.

The case for (and against) colorblindness

   The debate over "colorblind" remedies for racialdiscrimination has a
   history of more than 120 years in U.S. constitutional law.

   Justice John Marshall Harlan, the lone dissenter in the Supreme Court's
   1896 Plessy v. Ferguson decision that upheld "separate but equal"
   policies, said the Constitution prescribed color blindness in theory,
   but white supremacist policies were imposed in actuality.

   "The white race deems itself to be the dominant race in this country.
   And so it is in prestige, in achievements, in education and in power,"
   he wrote in his opposition to the 7-1 decision.

   "But in view of the Constitution, in the eye of the law, there is in
   this country no superior, dominant, ruling class of citizens. There is
   no caste here. Our Constitution is color-blind, and neither knows nor
   tolerates classes among citizens. In respect of civil rights, all
   citizens are equal before the law."

   In 1978, the Supreme Court upheld affirmative action plans in the case
   of Regents of the University of California v. Bakke. In support of that
   decision, Justice Harry Blackmun agreed with fellow Justice Thurgood
   Marshall's assertion that race must be considered.

   "In order to get beyond racism, we must first take account of race.
   There is no other way," Blackmun wrote. "And in order to treat some
   persons equally, we must treat them differently. We cannot--we dare
   not--let the Equal Protection Clause [of the 14th Amendment] perpetuate
   racial superiority."

   But others argue that colorblindness aligns with the country's founding
   principles. Peter C. Myers, a professor emeritus of political science
   at the University of Wisconsin-Eau Claire, said Blackmun was "sorely
   mistaken when he declared in defense of modern race preferences."

   Color-blindness requires that "distinctions of race or color play no
   proper part in the distributions of burdens and benefits in public law
   or policy" and "the recovery and secure establishment of the
   color-blindness principle in America's public life are urgent moral and
   civic imperatives," Myers wrote [102]in a 2019 article for the Heritage
   Foundation.

   Adia Harvey Wingfield, a sociology professor at Washington University
   in St. Louis, said some past efforts to remedy race-based problems in
   colorblind ways have widened or exacerbated racial inequality.

   Minimum wage and Social Security laws, for example, did not adequately
   address the situation of the disproportionately large number of Black
   Americans in low-pay domestic jobs.

   The G.I. Bill, which offered World War II veterans a range of financial
   benefits, including assistance for education and job training, was
   administered by states when segregation was the law in the South. Many
   state officials there steered Black veterans away from job training
   programs that could lead to higher-paying jobs, and to college degrees
   at Black schools that were underfunded rather than predominantly white
   institutions.

   And while legal school segregation was technically eliminated by the
   Supreme Court in 1954 and by subsequent civil rights legislation, it
   was effectively replaced by de facto segregation in schools drawing
   students from neighborhoods that still show the impacts of white
   supremacist efforts to keep people separated by race.

   "One of the things that's so useful about historical research from that
   time period is that it shows multiple examples of race-blind public
   policy that still made sure racial inequality stayed in place,"
   Wingfield said in a recent interview.

   "Trying to solve racial inequality by not talking about racial
   inequality doesn't reduce racial inequality," she said. "It leaves it
   there to continue to be perpetuated in existing forms."

Terminated contractor files case against USA Cricket for 'racial
discrimination'

   The lawsuit, filed by Kirk Greaves, seeks a total of $2 million dollars
   in damages
   Peter Della Penna
   [77]Peter Della Penna
   13-May-2022
   Kirk Greaves (C) was terminated from an independent contractor role
   early last month, Lauderhill, December 23, 2021

   Kirk Greaves (middle) on December 23, 2021, in Lauderhill, Florida, at
   a T20I between USA and Ireland   o   Peter Della Penna
   In the midst of a [78]protracted legal battle regarding the delayed
   general elections from 2020, USA Cricket now has a second lawsuit on
   its hands after Kirk Greaves, who was terminated from an
   independent-contractor role early last month, filed legal action in the
   US Federal Court against the national governing body claiming "racial
   discrimination in employment".
   The lawsuit, which was filed by Greaves on April 28 in the Northern
   District of California (USA Cricket is headquartered in San Francisco)
   is seeking a total of $2 million dollars in damages: $150,000 in
   economic damages owing to lost future wages; $350,000 in non-economic
   damages for "psychological stress and humiliation"; and $1.5 million in
   punitive damages.
   "USA Cricket is aware of various details of a lawsuit being brought by
   a former contractor against USA Cricket," a USA Cricket spokesperson
   said to ESPNcricinfo in an emailed statement. "The individual is one of
   a number of contractors previously engaged by USA Cricket whose
   contracts were recently not renewed. All allegations in the lawsuit are
   entirely false and without merit, and USA Cricket denies and will
   aggressively defend against them. The matter is currently in the hands
   of USA Cricket's lawyers. We look forward to the case being dismissed
   in due course and will not be making any further comment at this time."
   Prior to working for USA Cricket, Greaves, a native of Barbados, worked
   as Team Operations Manager for Barbados Tridents for three seasons in
   the Caribbean Premier League from 2016 to 2018. He was also appointed
   as Tournament Operations Manager for the Global T20 Canada when it
   launched in 2018 and worked in an operations role for Rajasthan Royals
   during the 2019 IPL. According to the lawsuit, Greaves claims he was
   brought on board by USA Cricket as an independent contractor for a
   four-month probationary period as a Cricket Operations Manager
   beginning in March 2021 at an initial wage of $5,000 per month and
   tasked with executing four domestic cricket tournaments.
   Greaves claims a verbal agreement was in place with then board CEO Iain
   Higgins to give him an offer of full-time employment, contingent upon
   the successful completion of the four domestic tournaments. However,
   Greaves was never subsequently presented with a full-time job offer and
   claims that the budget which was allegedly allocated for the role was
   instead repackaged as an increased salary offer to a white employee.
   Among other allegations, Greaves states that he was subjected to a
   "toxic work environment, unfair employment practices, wage disparity
   and discrimination". Greaves claims that he was the only black staff
   member and also the only American citizen on staff and, as such, he was
   "hired to diversify the management of USA Cricket. It would appear that
   only the Australians, Indians, New Zealanders and other non-Americans
   have benefitted from the USA Cricket brand".
   Though their employment status is not considered full-time, USA Cricket
   currently has three other black men - who are all American citizens -
   serving in staff leadership roles affiliated with its national teams:
   John Aaron as USA Women's national team manager, Kerk Higgins as USA
   men's national team manager, and Kevin Darlington in the dual role of
   USA men's assistant coach and USA U-19 men's head coach.
   Greaves also claims in the suit that he suffered humiliation after
   having his role reclassified from "Cricket Operations Manager" to
   "Events Manager", and that the renaming of his role resulted in
   "eliminating any element of black representation at the senior
   management level", something he claims "was racially orchestrated and
   violated US law". Greaves also writes that his job status was that of a
   permanent employee but claims that classifying him as an independent
   contractor "demonstrates bad faith and is a contravention of US labor
   laws".
   On March 28, a letter was sent by USA Cricket Operations Director
   Richard Done to Greaves notifying him that his independent contractor
   agreement - which had been $6,500 for the final five months, an
   increase of $1,500 above his original - was being terminated as of
   April 8, "pursuant to the decision of the Cricket Committee". However,
   Greaves claims that he received an email disputing this from USA
   Cricket board member Srini Salver. In the email, which is attached in
   an exhibit as part of the lawsuit filing, Salver writes to Greaves that
   "your termination was never recommended by the Cricket Committee" in
   any board meeting but was instead discussed during a conversation about
   budgets.
   "The budget isn't approved, nor are the terminations," Salver allegedly
   wrote to Greaves. Salver is one of the two board member plaintiffs,
   along with Venu Pisike, in the ongoing legal action filed against five
   other USA board members and then USA Cricket CEO Iain Higgins over the
   legality of new members being allowed voting status in the case about
   the delayed elections from 2020.
   A court hearing date for the Greaves lawsuit has been set for August 2.

Learn from the past, `stand united against racism' - UN chief

   25 March 2022 [69]Human Rights

   "Let us stand united against racism and together build societies based
   on dignity, equality and solidarity", the UN chief said on
   Friday, [70]International Day of Remembrance of the Victims of Slavery.

   For more than 400 years, over 15 million men, women and children became
   the victims of the tragic transatlantic slave trade, in one of human
   history's darkest chapters.

   On #RememberSlavery Day we pay tribute to the millions of Africans who
   were torn from their homelands during the Transatlantic Slave
   Trade.People of African descent confront racialdiscrimination to this
   day.Let's #FightRacism &amp; build societies based on equality.

   Ant?nio Guterres, UN Secretary-General
   antonioguterres

   "There is much that we know about the transatlantic trade in enslaved
   Africans," [71]Secretary-General Ant?nio Guterres [72]said in his
   message commemorating the day.

   He said it was a clear crime against humanity, pointing to the
   unprecedented scale of the human trafficking that took place, the
   degrading economic transactions involved, and "unspeakable" human
   rights violations.

Racist legacy lives on

   But, added the UN chief, "there is also much that we do not know, and
   today is a day we learn".

   Behind the facts and figures, he reminded that there are millions of
   human stories.

   "Stories of untold suffering and pain...of families and communities
   ripped apart but also stories of awe-inspiring courage and defiance
   against the cruelty of oppressors".

   While the world will never know every act of resistance - great or
   small - that slowly but surely triumphed over injustice, repression and
   enslavement, he maintained that those accounts are "crucial to our
   understanding of a past whose most pernicious and persistent legacy
   continues to blight our present: racism".

Stand in solidarity

   The International Day is a time to learn about and reflect on those
   stories and pay tribute to the millions of Africans who were torn from
   their homelands and communities, said Mr. Guterres, and "stand up in
   solidarity against racism everywhere."

`Discrimination, marginalization and exclusion'

   Today, people of African descent "continue to confront racial
   discrimination, marginalization and exclusion," he said.

   Political, economic and structural power imbalances that were rooted in
   colonial rule, enslavement and exploitation, continue today to deny
   equality of opportunity and justice.

   Against this backdrop, the Secretary-General urged everyone to stand up
   against racism today and every day.

   Victims of Slavery and the Transatlantic Slave Trade - International
   Day of Remembrance 2022

`Eradicate the global scourge'

   In his message, General Assembly President Abdulla Shahid underscored
   the need to "discuss the legacy of slavery," especially in the
   marginalization of persons of African descent, "who are still denied
   justice and equality".

   "Let's stand in solidarity, united against these inequalities," he
   said. "This dark chapter should never be whitewashed".

   Natalia Kanem, head of the UN agency dedicated to advancing sexual
   reproductive health and rights and ending gender-based violence,
   [74]UNFPA, said that while remembering the victims of enslavement and
   the centuries-long transatlantic trade, "let us unite to eradicate the
   global scourge of racism".

Are Asian Americans victims of racism or beneficiaries of whiteness? It's
complex.

It's time to discard this simplistic dichotomy.

   A question that seems to be asked with increasing frequency is whether
   Asian Americans are the beneficiaries of privileges historically
   afforded to white people in the United States or if we are the victims
   of racialdiscrimination. But reality is much more complex. It's time
   to discard this simplistic dichotomy.

   Take the [124]Students for Fair Admissions v[125]. Harvard case to be
   heard in the US Supreme Court in October. Plaintiffs in the case argue
   that Asian Americans experience racialdiscrimination in Harvard
   admissions, as evidenced, they claim, by admitted Asian American
   students' higher GPAs and SAT scores compared to admitted students of
   all other races, including white students. They also point to
   admissions officers' lower "personal" ratings of Asian American
   applicants compared to those of other students. Harvard and its
   defenders have responded in part by pointing to the [126]increasing
   percentage of Asian Americans admitted every year. The university also
   points out that academics are not the only criterion they use to admit
   students.

   In 2019, federal Judge Allison Burroughs [127]affirmed Harvard's
   admissions practices as legally sound in her ruling but also recognized
   the [128]possibility of anti-Asian discrimination in "personal"
   ratings. Asian Americans also experience [129]glass ceilings in
   corporate firms and [130]bullying in schools. Since the onset of the
   COVID-19 pandemic, Asian Americans have experienced increased
   [131]physical attacks. It's clear that anti-Asian discrimination is
   real. A high percentage of Asian American students admitted to Harvard
   does not preclude the possibility of anti-Asian racism.

   On the other hand, Asian Americans' overall high SAT scores and GPAs
   are driven, in part, by privileges made for and normally afforded to
   middle-class white Americans. Many Asian Americans have been able to
   benefit from these advantages. Why? US immigration policy has meant
   that [132]a large proportion of immigrants from Asia come with college
   and even graduate degrees. High incomes enable a significant number of
   them to move to [133]well-off suburbs historically designed as islands
   of privilege for upper-middle-class white people leaving
   [134]integrated cities.

   Those municipalities have, for decades, been able to offer a top-notch
   public education -- they can provide more opportunities given their
   high tax bases -- and they have fewer poverty-related challenges to
   address, as well. Those advantages -- along with highly skilled Asian
   parents' dexterity in educational testing (that's what got them into
   top colleges in Asia) and [135]positive stereotypes teachers often have
   about Asian Americans' academic capability -- facilitate Asian American
   kids' high levels of academic achievement. In this regard, Asian
   Americans do indeed benefit from [136]"whiteness" as a system of
   advantage. In other words, the US education system has racially unequal
   opportunities and hence outcomes baked into it, and Asian Americans
   have actually benefited from that racial inequality that historically
   has privileged white students over Black and Latinx students.

   Taking this history into account when making admissions decisions means
   we'd expect Asian American and white students' SAT scores and GPAs to
   be higher than those of Black, Latinx, and Native American students on
   average. Of course, [137]Asian Americans are diverse, and working-class
   Asian Americans do not experience the benefits of living in well-off
   neighborhoods, even if [138]some may benefit from teachers' positive
   stereotypes about Asian Americans' academic capabilities.

   I found these dual forces of race operating in [139]my own research in
   a well-off East Coast suburb with a large and growing Asian American
   population. This was a town that, [140]like many affluent suburbs
   around the country -- from San Jose, Calif., to Weston, Mass. -- had
   many years ago passed laws to prevent working-class people from moving
   in, such as minimum housing lot size requirements and limits on the
   building of multifamily homes. The historical record shows that laws
   like these and [141]the choices many white Americans made (and continue
   to make) about where to live were frequently related to a desire to
   steer clear of Black people in particular. Many suburban properties
   even had explicit racially restrictive covenants, which barred the sale
   of those properties to Black buyers. These covenants were legal until
   the Fair Housing Act of 1968.

   Even today, Black middle-class professionals frequently do not choose
   to live in towns like the one I studied, in part because [142]they
   understand the problems likely to ensue if their children do not have
   peers who share their racial identity. [143]Racial steering by real
   estate agents also keeps them away.

   But Asian Americans have had a different experience in the United
   States. The history of residential segregation between Black and white
   Americans, ironically, enabled Asian American professionals to reap the
   benefits of living in communities segregated by class and previously by
   race. Some see evidence like this as meaning that Asian Americans are
   "white adjacent."

   But [144]in my research I also found evidence of anti-Asian racism.
   Many white parents expressed disdain for Asian American parenting,
   which, they observed, enabled Asian American students to outperform
   white students academically. For example, one white mom complained to
   me about the presence of kids whose parents had academic standards she
   deemed unreasonably high, describing one to me by saying, "her name is
   not Sally Smith. ... It's never the blonde Norwegian."

   To be sure, anti-Asian American racism is not the same as anti-Black
   racism. The two are driven by different stereotypes and appear in
   different spheres of social life. There is no point in trying to
   measure whether one is "worse" than the other. They are different, and
   we must find ways for both to end.

   To do so, we must stop assuming that Asian American academic
   achievement means the end of anti-Asian racism or that Asian Americans
   sometimes benefiting from privileges previously reserved for white
   Americans means we always benefit from the privileges of whiteness. The
   multifaceted nature of racialdiscrimination and privilege in the
   United States is far more complex. To tackle it, we need to understand
   its diverse faces.

   The impact of COVID-19 has been disproportionately felt by populations
   experiencing structural racial- and ethnicity-based discrimination.
   Here, we describe opportunities for COVID-19 response and recovery
   efforts to help build more equal and resilient societies, through
   investments in: (i) interventions focused on explicitly addressing
   racial and ethnicity-based discrimination; (ii) interventions
   supporting the delivery of universal services, and in ways that address
   compounding and intersecting drivers of exclusion and marginalization;
   and (iii) cross-cutting enabling measures, such as participatory
   mechanisms and data disaggregation.

   More than two years since the first SARS-CoV-2 infections were
   reported, the COVID-19 pandemic remains an acute global
   emergency^[73]1. While many countries have successfully vaccinated
   significant portions of their populations, stark global inequities
   remain with imbalance in the global distribution of
   vaccines^[74]2,[75]3, and potential new variants could further threaten
   the ability of governments to recover from the inter-connected health,
   economic, and broader human rights crises. Within countries, the impact
   of COVID-19 has been disproportionately felt by populations
   experiencing structural racial- and ethnicity-based discrimination.
   Indeed, where disaggregated epidemiologic data are available, COVID-19
   morbidity and mortality rates are often significantly higher among
   people of African descent, indigenous peoples, and ethnic groups or
   other minoritized groups experiencing discrimination^[76]4,[77]5,[78]6.
   This reflects what social epidemiologists have long recognized: disease
   distribution is patterned by structures of disadvantage, inequality,
   marginalization and discrimination that often have historical roots and
   still have present-day manifestations^[79]7. Importantly, "race" is
   purely a social construct that has no biological basis, and documented
   racial inequities are due to racism not genetics or biology.

   Ethnicity-based and racialdiscrimination intersects with other forms
   of exclusion based on income, occupation, gender identity and
   expression, sexual orientation, disability, religion or belief,
   language, migratory status, rural/urban status and more, and is
   unlikely to exist in only one sector. Beyond health inequities,
   COVID-19 racial and ethnicity-based inequities have been documented
   across employment, education, housing and food insecurity, among other
   domains^[80]8. There are different pathways - from differential
   exposure, to inequitable access to health services, to uneven
   socioeconomic impacts of control measures, that can be further studied
   to inform policymaking, planning and programming^[81]9. Yet, these
   unequal impacts and human rights violations are not inevitable; neither
   is a spike in xenophobia and hate speech^[82]10.

   As countries work to respond to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and
   address both health challenges and broader socio-economic impacts,
   attention must be given to tackling racial and ethnic discrimination.
   With this in mind, and consistent with the UN Secretary General's Call
   to Action for Human Rights^[83]11, members of the United Nations
   Sustainable Development Group released a report on opportunities to
   address racial- and ethnicity-based discrimination^[84]12.

   The report was developed through a consultative process that began in
   late 2020 through early 2021, involving UN senior executives and
   technical staff, civil society, public health practitioners and human
   rights experts. It identified three strategic approaches to addressing
   racial and ethnicity-based discrimination in COVID-19 response and
   recovery efforts. These are: (i) interventions explicitly tackling
   racial and ethnicity-based discrimination, including improving
   anti-discrimination and redress mechanisms; (ii) interventions
   supporting the delivery of universal services, but in ways that address
   compounding and intersecting drivers of social exclusion and draw on
   the framework of proportionate universalism^[85]13; and (iii)
   investments in cross-cutting enabling measures, such as participatory
   mechanisms and data disaggregation (see Table [86]1 which is replicated
   from the report).
   Table 1 Summary of potential entry points to address racial- and
   ethnicity-based discrimination, replicated from UN report.
   [87]Full size table

   While not exhaustive and recognizing that entry-points would need to be
   tailored to national circumstances and developed in consultation with
   impacted communities, these mutually reinforcing entry-points together
   offer a framework to address discrimination directly through targeted
   measures, and indirectly through universal measures that will have
   amplified impacts on disadvantaged populations. This framework is
   currently being used in a capacity-building programme for United
   Nations Country Teams to support national policies and programmes that
   result in more just, equal and resilient societies. To date, thirteen
   UN Country Teams have participated in the programme and a
   training-of-trainers is planned for late 2022 to reach more, under the
   umbrella of the UN Network on addressing racialdiscrimination and the
   Protection of Minorities.

Explicitly tackle racial and ethnicity-based discrimination

   COVID-19 made clear that there is a need for explicit policies to
   tackle racial and ethnicity-based discrimination in the immediate term,
   to address current pressing needs, and in the long term. The
   longstanding impact of colonialism, theft of land, resources and
   exclusionary actions, for example, left indigenous peoples more
   vulnerable to COVID-19. Indigenous peoples already faced numerous
   obstacles to equitably accessing health services, including because of
   geographical barriers posed by the organization of provider networks,
   difficulty affording medical care, or difficulties in accessing
   culturally appropriate care that is in their own language and that
   respects their cultural beliefs, traditions and practices^[88]14.
   During the COVID-19 pandemic the world also witnessed a rise in
   episodes of xenophobia, hate speech, abuses, assaults, harassment,
   scapegoating, stigmatization and increase in excessive immigration
   control measures^[89]15.

   Countries can use this opportunity of heightened sensitivity to health
   inequities to adopt or strengthen existing anti-discrimination laws and
   policies that align with international human rights standards. These
   should extend beyond health care to address discrimination in the
   workplace, housing, education, law enforcement and border control
   sectors, among others. States must meet their obligations to respect,
   protect and fulfill the rights of everyone guaranteed under the
   International Convention on the Elimination of all Forms of Racial
   Discrimination by, for example, equipping existing autonomous national
   institutions to guarantee protection, effective implementation of
   anti-discrimination laws and policies, and access to justice for
   individual or collective complaints.

   Accurate communications and public messages centered on solidarity,
   tolerance, and inclusion are needed to combat scapegoating, `othering'
   or victim-blaming narratives that continue to exacerbate harm. Just as
   with past epidemics which have often resulted in human rights abuses
   and discriminatory enforcement of public health measures, as well as
   segregationist public health strategies^[90]16, concerns were raised
   around emergency measures inappropriately targeting groups, including
   migrants, refugees and asylum seekers, and the excessive and selective
   use of police and military for enforcement^[91]17. For example,
   longstanding anti-Roma racism in Europe, including violent and targeted
   oppression over centuries, resurfaced through inflammatory rhetoric and
   scapegoating during COVID-19^[92]18.

Addressing compounding and intersecting drivers of exclusion

   COVID-19 made inequities experienced by persons facing ethnicity-based
   and racialdiscrimination more visible, but unfair and discriminatory
   practices in education, housing, labor markets, the criminal justice
   system, to name a few, are often overlapping and compounding, and did
   not emerge simply as a result of the pandemic. Universal and
   rights-based strategies such as temporary moratoria on
   evictions^[93]19, expanded social protection nets, enhanced labor
   protections including for workers in the informal economy, expansion of
   free Wi-Fi and open education resources, release and decarceration
   efforts - among other measures - can have a differential positive
   impact on populations experiencing racial and ethnicity-based
   discrimination. This is because structural racism acts to skew
   distributions such that excluded and marginalized groups are
   over-represented among those working in the informal economy, those
   facing housing insecurity, those deprived of education, those living in
   poverty and those facing obstacles to justice. An intersectional
   analysis to comprehensively address the multiple and overlapping
   structural drivers of inequality, for example with regards to gender
   identity, religion, ableness, or citizenship status, in addition to
   race and ethnicity, is essential in COVID-19 recovery plans.

   Place-based strategies^[94]20, including neighborhood and
   community-based interventions, can similarly help mitigate the
   disproportionate impact of COVID-19 in geographic regions that have
   historically been underserved and contain large numbers of people that
   may have experienced racial and ethnicity-based discrimination. For
   example, investments in infrastructure, including health
   infrastructure, can help to ensure basic minimum needs for shelter,
   health, water, sanitation and hygiene are being met during and
   following the pandemic, while also generating employment opportunities
   in the immediate term for residents of underserved areas.

Invest in enabling and human rights-based approaches

   Although there are both direct and indirect strategies through which
   plans to build forward better from the COVID-19 pandemic can begin to
   address structural racism and ethnicity-based discrimination, as
   described above, these actions will only be successful if they address
   power inequities and are developed through participatory and inclusive
   approaches, ensuring historically excluded communities have
   decision-making power and adequate resources. COVID-19 response and
   recovery plans could earmark resources for civil society organizations
   working to address discrimination, social exclusion and human rights.

   In the immediate term, investments in systems to disaggregate data by
   race and/or ethnicity, as well as other dimensions that can help
   address the intersectional impact on particular groups, are needed. It
   is essential that these are accompanied by investments in data
   protection. These investments and other equity analysis tools can help
   unpack inequalities across groups both as a direct result of COVID-19
   and because of unevenly distributed impacts of pandemic-related
   measures and uneven socioeconomic consequences. Importantly, mechanisms
   for transparent data reporting that allow for public accountability
   will be critical. In many contexts, investment in vital statistics and
   civil registration will also be needed, since the pandemic highlighted
   that many people in need of emergency social protection were unable to
   access benefits because they lacked proper identification^[95]21.
   Similarly, efforts should be made to ensure that the needs of those
   with precarious legal identity status are also met.

Conclusion

   Inequalities in who gets sick and who suffers long-term socioeconomic
   consequences during and following a pandemic are largely shaped by
   unequal political power dynamics and how societies structure their
   economies, laws and policies and broader governance mechanisms. This
   tragic pandemic has further shone the light on grave and historic
   injustices and inequalities, both within and across countries, and
   should be an impetus for countries to strengthen their efforts to
   address systemic racism and ethnicity-based discrimination. Lessons
   learned from the COVID-19 pandemic also include the importance of
   prevention and the high cost of inaction. Parallels can easily be drawn
   around the need for urgent and concerted action to address the climate
   emergency if we are to prevent the unnecessary and unequal health
   impact of climate change^[96]22. This opportunity should not be wasted.

Young activists do not trust their Government on racialdiscrimination

   July 1, 2020
   [172]racialdiscrimination, one young world ? John Gomez

Research from [173]One Young World's global network shows that 74% of their
Peace Ambassadors do not believe racialdiscrimination will be changed by
their politicians

   New research from One Young World's global network of the young leaders
   highlights how far we still are from [174]achieving racial justice -
   with 74% of its Peace Ambassadors stating they have no trust in their
   government to address the issue in the long-term.

   Reinforcing this lack of trust in existing leadership, the findings
   show that over half of the activists surveyed do not think their
   government will use the current civil rights movement to make
   meaningful progress in addressing[175] racialdiscrimination.

   The survey was undertaken with One Young World's Peace Ambassadors - a
   global network of young leaders on the front line of peace-building
   around the world supported by the European Commission and Dutch
   Ministry of Foreign Affairs.

What do young activists think about the world?

   An overwhelming majority of the young leaders surveyed do not have
   faith in the school system or the media (84% and 85% respectively) to
   educate and report on racial equality properly - highlighting the need
   for change across every corner of society to achieve real social
   justice.

   The findings also highlight effective means of change making and found
   two thirds of young leaders believe social media is the most important
   tool for activism in 2020.

   In the wake of sustained police brutality in the United States of
   America, the world has been forced to pay attention to racial
   injustice. With the deaths of George Floyd, Breonna Taylor, Elijah
   McClain, and countless others, a wide expanse of global society has
   been galvanised to what Barack Obama describes as an "awakening". The
   perception of racism in the US is particularly evolving, with 59% of
   swing voters agreeing with the ideas of Black Lives Matter. The
   defunding of police as a federal conversation and possibility is
   currently derailed, due to the ongoing intel revelations concerning
   Russia and American soldiers.

   Currently, 1 in 4 of the young activists surveyed do not believe
   equality will be achieved in the next 5 years - and 1 in 5 do not
   believe we will ever achieve equality globally.

Who are the Peace Ambassadors?

   o Satta Sheriff, Liberia - Founder of Youth in Action for Peace and
   Empowerment, an NGO dedicated to defending and protecting the rights of
   Liberian children and vulnerable groups.
   o Achaleke Christian, Cameroon - Founder of Prisonpreneurs, a
   rapidly-expanding initiative that was established to counter one of the
   biggest causes of violent extremism: poverty and lack of economic
   opportunities.

   Ella Robertson, Managing Director of One Young World, said:

   "In the past month, we have seen racial injustices brought into the
   spotlight as people globally call for action on inequality.

   "At One Young World, we believe that at the heart of every global
   threat is a failure of leadership and the findings in this recent
   research from our Peace Ambassadors reinforce just that. We are proud
   of our global network of young leaders working hard to create a better
   world - with more responsible, and more effective leadership.

   The continued support of One Young World peace programmes supported by
   the European Commission and Dutch Ministry of Foreign Affairs mean we
   can connect leading activists around the world who are all changing
   their community, and the world, for the better.

DPIC Releases Report Placing Death Penalty in Historical Context as a
"Descendant of Slavery, Lynching, and Segregation"

Death Penalty Must Be Part of Current Debate About Criminal Legal System
Reforms

   (Washington, D.C.) As social movements pressure policymakers to redress
   injustices in the criminal legal system and to institute reforms to
   make the process more fair and equitable, the Death Penalty Information
   Center (DPIC) today released, [144]"Enduring Injustice: the Persistence
   of racialdiscrimination in the U.S. Death Penalty." This report
   provides an in-depth look at the historical role that race has played
   in the death penalty and details the pervasive role racial
   discrimination continues to play in the administration of capital
   punishment today.

   "The death penalty has been used to enforce racial hierarchies
   throughout United States history, beginning with the colonial period
   and continuing to this day," said Ngozi Ndulue, DPIC's Senior Director
   of Research and Special Projects and the report's lead author. "Its
   discriminatory presence as the apex punishment in the American legal
   system legitimizes all other harsh and discriminatory punishments. That
   is why the death penalty must be part of any discussion of police
   reform, prosecutorial accountability, reversing mass incarceration, and
   the criminal legal system as a whole." Ms. Ndulue previously served as
   the NAACP's Senior Director of Criminal Justice Programs and as a
   capital appeals lawyer.

   "Racial disparities are present at every stage of a capital case and
   get magnified as a case moves through the legal process," said Robert
   Dunham, DPIC's Executive Director and the report's editor. "If you
   don't understand the history -- that the modern death penalty is the
   direct descendant of slavery, lynching, and Jim Crow-segregation -- you
   won't understand why. With the continuing police and white vigilante
   killings of Black citizens, it is even more important now to focus
   attention on the outsized role the death penalty plays as an agent and
   validator of racialdiscrimination. What is broken or intentionally
   discriminatory in the criminal legal system is visibly worse in
   death-penalty cases. Exposing how the system discriminates in capital
   cases can shine an important light on law enforcement and judicial
   practices in vital need of abolition, restructuring, or reform."

   The report documents the historic role of the U.S. death penalty as an
   instrument of social control. During slavery, capital punishment was a
   tool for controlling Black populations and curbing rebellions. After
   the Civil War, public officials promised legal executions as a means to
   discourage lynchings. As lynchings decreased in the early 20^th
   century, executions began to take their place in circumstances that
   earlier would have drawn a lynch mob. Across the South,
   African-American men were condemned and executed for the alleged rape
   or attempted rape of white women or girls. No white man was ever
   executed for raping a Black woman or girl.

   Racial bias persists today, as evidenced by cases with white victims
   being more likely to be investigated and capitally charged; systemic
   exclusion of jurors of color from service in death-penalty trials; and
   disproportionate imposition of death sentences against defendants of
   color. The report provides compelling evidence of racial bias in the
   modern death penalty, including:
     * A 2015 meta-analysis of 30 studies showed that the killers of white
       people were more likely than the killers of Black people to face a
       capital prosecution.
     * A study in North Carolina showed that qualified Black jurors were
       struck from juries at more than twice the rate of qualified white
       jurors. As of 2010, 20 percent of those on the state's death row
       were sentenced to death by all-white juries.
     * Since executions resumed in 1977, 295 African-Americans defendants
       have been executed for the murder of a white victim, while only 21
       white defendants have been executed for the murder of an
       African-American victim.
     * A 2014 mock jury study of more than 500 Californians found that
       white jurors were more likely to sentence poor Latinx defendants to
       death than poor white defendants.
     * Exonerations of African Americans for murder convictions are 22
       percent more likely to be linked to police misconduct.

   The report highlights several pending death penalty cases where racial
   discrimination played a role in driving death sentences for Black
   defendants. For example:
     * Abu-Ali Abdur'Rahman, Tennessee. In 2019, Davidson County District
       Attorney General Glenn Funk conceded that Abu-Ali Abdur'Rahman's
       trial had been infected by overt racial bias. Abdur'Rahman had long
       argued that the prosecutor struck two Black potential jurors based
       on racial stereotypes. The trial court agreed to a reduced
       sentence, but the Tennessee Attorney General's Office is currently
       appealing.
     * Julius Jones, Oklahoma. Julius Jones, who has a strong innocence
       claim, was convicted and sentenced to death by a nearly all-white
       jury for killing a white businessman. His case was riddled with
       racialdiscrimination, including an officer using a racial slur
       during his arrest, prosecutors striking every Black potential juror
       but one, and a juror who used the n-word to describe Jones. His
       petition for clemency is currently pending.
     * Federal Death Penalty. Although the first set of executions
       scheduled by the federal government in 2020 have been strategically
       directed at white people, the federal death penalty has long been
       plagued by the same racial bias present in state death penalty
       systems. Thirty-four of the 57 people currently on federal death
       row are people of color, including 26 Black men. Some were
       convicted and condemned by all-white juries. In an action widely

On the International Stage: SPLC to present evidence of systemic racism in US
to UN committee in Geneva

   August 05, 2022
   Esther Schrader

   When Terrance Winn takes a seat on a flight to Geneva this month as
   part of a Southern Poverty Law Center delegation traveling to address a
   United Nations committee, it will be an extraordinary departure for a
   man who until two years ago had been incarcerated for 30 years.

   But as he looks out over the ocean separating himself from his former
   life, Winn will be a fitting symbol of the departure the delegation
   represents for the SPLC. Long rooted in advocating for racial justice
   at home, the organization will for the first time formally appeal to an
   international body to recognize systemic racism in the United States as
   a human rights emergency of global concern.

   [62]Winn, who was released two years ago from the vast Louisiana State
   Penitentiary known as "Angola," has become a widely respected advocate
   for prison reform.

   Several members of the SPLC's leadership team will accompany Winn.
   Leading the delegation is Lisa Borden, senior policy counsel. Borden
   heads the SPLC's new international advocacy initiative -- established
   last December. A civil rights lawyer in Alabama for three decades,
   Borden joined the SPLC last year and is charged with using the pressure
   of international condemnation as a powerful new mechanism for advocacy
   in a country where democratic institutions are in peril.

   Also with the delegation will be SPLC Chief Policy Officer LaShawn
   Warren, along with [63]Page Dukes, a formerly incarcerated Georgia
   woman who since 2019 has worked on voting rights and other issues at
   the [64]Southern Center for Human Rights.

   Together the delegation will carve a new path for an organization that
   -- since its founding in 1971 as a small law firm working to help
   implement federal civil rights legislation and constitutional
   guarantees -- has focused its [65]legal work within the U.S., even as
   it evolved into a powerful advocate for the human rights of all people.

   Now, the SPLC is looking to international institutions for added focus
   on the dearth of justice experienced by many in the Deep South and
   across the U.S.

   "We have always had people who bring the question of justice to the
   courts, and we have always had people who work on policy, on the state
   level and more recently on the federal level," Borden said. "Now we
   want to bring the gaze of our international peers to the deep issues of
   civil and political rights plaguing America."

Seeking international pressure

   The occasion is the 107th session of the [66]U.N. Committee on the
   Elimination of racialdiscrimination (CERD), a body of independent
   experts that monitors implementation of the [67]International
   Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of racialdiscrimination.
   The treaty has been signed by 128 countries, including the U.S., and is
   the oldest and most widely ratified U.N. rights convention.

   Governments party to the treaty come under review by CERD regularly,
   generally every four years. Along with reports submitted by the
   governments, human rights organizations like the SPLC can submit their
   own reports, giving their perspectives, concerns and evidence of the
   country, its public officials or institutions engaging in racial
   discrimination against individuals, groups of people or organizations.

   The committee issues recommendations based on the reports it receives.
   Though it has no mechanism to enforce those recommendations, the
   pressure of its public reports can have an impact.

   The U.S. has an ambivalent history with CERD. It signed the treaty in
   1966, but Congress did not ratify it for nearly three decades -- until
   Oct. 21, 1994. And while the treaty commits the U.S. to "adopt all
   necessary measures for speedily eliminating racialdiscrimination," the
   American Bar Association found in 2020 that the U.S. "has consistently
   failed to meaningfully uphold this mandate."

   Since ratifying the treaty, the U.S. has nullified its impact by
   submitting reservations, failing to enact anti-racism legislation,
   preventing citizens from bringing claims under the treaty and failing
   to deliver timely reports of measures it has taken to address racial
   discrimination.

   During the administration of former President Donald Trump, CERD's work
   was ignored entirely. The U.S. was to have submitted a report to it in
   2018 but did not begin working on one until President Joe Biden took
   office in January 2021. The Biden administration has pledged a new
   level of commitment to CERD.

`Move the needle'

   Back when those pledges by the new administration were being made, Winn
   was recently out of prison, home in Shreveport, Louisiana, for the
   first time since he was arrested at age 16 and convicted of murder
   after a fight broke out between him and another man and an innocent
   bystander was killed. Now 48, he is the executive director of a
   nonprofit organization he created -- Priorities, Intentions and
   Practical Exchanges (PIPE) -- which seeks to keep young people out of
   prison and to help people recently released.

   Winn will speak to CERD about conditions in U.S. prisons and about the
   toll on incarcerated people who have been subjected to solitary
   confinement. Winn said he spent more than half his 30 years of
   incarceration in solitary, much of it at Angola, the largest
   penitentiary in the U.S. Built on the site of a former plantation,
   Angola is infamous for its harsh conditions.

   Despite the hardship he endured, Winn was able to emerge from prison
   with a GED diploma, then a culinary degree. Now he is a student at
   Houston Community College. Eventually, Winn said, he hopes to go to law
   school. He received special permission from his parole board to travel
   to Geneva.

   "What is the message I am bringing [to the United Nations committee]?
   That the U.S. calls itself the leader of the free world, and it will
   put any country on trial that doesn't treat its people right, but,
   well, the U.S. isn't treating its own people right," Winn said.

   "Let's look at the fact that in disproportionate numbers a Black person
   is going to go to prison in his lifetime, especially in the South. And
   once they get there, they are going to see barbarity, they are going to
   see corruption, they are going to - well, they might not go insane, but
   I can tell you from my own life, they are going to experience moments
   of insanity. How is that making us a model for the free world?"

   The SPLC is filing reports to the committee that ask the same questions
   about a series of pressing issues topping its agenda. Among them are
   the discrimination and abuse of Black migrants to the U.S.; the impact
   of mass incarceration on children and families; the use of corporal
   punishment in schools; voter suppression and disenfranchisement of
   voters with felony convictions; the vast disparities in education and
   health care funding; the impact on minority communities of the denial
   of abortion care; and the stark rise in recent years in hate speech and
   hate crimes.

   "Taking a stand for accountability and integrity in our own nation is
   central to the mission of the SPLC today," said Warren, the SPLC's
   chief policy officer. "We cannot hold other countries to standards that
   we are not applying to ourselves."

   The goal of the reports and the first-person testimony by people like
   Winn and [68]Dukes is "to move the needle," Borden said.

   "Anybody who engages in international human rights advocacy or any type
   of diplomacy, you have to be someone who can accept incremental
   change," Borden said. "But what we want is for the committee to
   understand what has gone wrong and for them to adopt specific
   recommendations that we and other organizations make about what the
   U.S. can and should do, because those are the tools we can then use to
   push the White House, the State Department, to talk to other agencies,
   even to talk to members of Congress about what it should really mean
   for the U.S. to call itself a human rights leader around the world."

   CNN  --

   The US Justice Department on Wednesday filed what it is describing as a
   first-of-its-kind settlement in a racialdiscrimination case
   challenging a so-called "crime-free housing ordinance."

   The [132]proposed consent decree was filed Wednesday in a lawsuit the
   Justice Department [133]brought in 2019 against the central California
   city of Hesperia, alleging that the city's ordinance violated the Fair
   Housing Act's prohibitions on racialdiscrimination in housing access.

   Hesperia continues to deny the allegations.

   According to DOJ's court filings, the 2015 ordinance instructed
   landlords to evict tenants accused of criminal conduct, even if those
   allegations have not resulted in an arrest or a conviction.

   "As our complaint makes clear, Hesperia's ordinance was a blatantly
   racially discriminatory solution to a problem that didn't exist,"
   Assistant Attorney General Kristen Clarke, who leads the DOJ Civil
   Rights division, said on a press call Wednesday.

   She noted under the program, Black renters were almost four times more
   likely to be evicted than White renters and Latino renters were 29%
   more likely to be evicted.

   She said that some 2,000 jurisdictions across 48 states have enacted
   similar policies and that the new settlement sent a signal to other
   communities that they'd be held accountable if their housing policies
   violated anti-discrimination law.

   "This landmark agreement is historic," Clarke said. "It marks the
   Justice Department's first settlement in a case challenge a crime-free
   ordinance and results in the full repeal of the program and nearly $1
   million in monetary commitment."

   Last month, the city repealed the ordinance, which was previously
   amended in 2017 to make the program voluntary. According to the Justice
   Department, Hesperia and its co-defendants - the county of San
   Bernardino and the San Bernardino Sheriffs Department - have agreed to
   pay a $950,000 settlement.

   It will compensate people who were harmed under the policy and will
   cover anti-discrimination training and other initiatives.

   A lawyer for Hesperia said that the city's move to resolve the case
   "was based solely on a sound financial decision on behalf of the
   citizens of the City."

   "At no time has the City admitted liability in this matter, and the
   City continues to vehemently deny all allegations contained within the
   complaint filed by the Department of Justice," the lawyer, J. Pat
   Ferraris told CNN in an email.

UN's Bachelet hails `millions of voices' tackling racialdiscrimination

   28 March 2022 [69]Human Rights

   More than two decades after the signing of the [70]Durban Declaration
   and Programme of Action (PoA) - the UN's blueprint to tackle racism and
   other forms of discrimination -UN High Commissioner for Human Rights
   Michelle Bachelet on Monday, hailed the "millions of voices around the
   globe" who've made it their mission to eradicate the scourge, while
   also noting that more work needs to be done.

   In paying tributed to those who "relentlessly - and courageously -
   fight racism, racialdiscrimination, xenophobia and related
   intolerance," she [71]outlined to the Human Rights Council that
   progress was being made.

   "Powerful global movements against racism are shifting the status quo",
   the UN right chief said, pointing to the "worldwide protests against
   racism and racialdiscrimination" prompted by the murder of George
   Floyd in 2020, as a "testimony to the power of people and solidarity."

   "We are moving too slowly"-@mbachelet urges the [72]Human Rights
   Council #HRC49 to address protection gaps in fighting racism. "It is
   vital & urgent that we unite to accelerate the pace in the fight
   against #racism & racialdiscrimination:

More work needed

   In confronting the immense racism and discrimination that deeply
   permeate social structures and institutions, she noted that brave
   defenders are often met with "xenophobia and hate speech...[and]
   countless obstacles".

   Moreover, their skin colour, ethnic affiliation, religious beliefs, or
   birthplace endanger their own lives, the senior UN official continued.

   While welcoming the "considerable efforts" of rights defenders and
   encouraged by their progress, she acknowledged that millions continue
   to be threatened by racism.

   "Africans and people of African descent, Asians and people of Asian
   descent, indigenous peoples, migrants, and national, ethnic and
   linguistic minorities, continue to be confronted by racism, racial
   discrimination, inequality and exclusion.

   "This can often take the form of Islamophobia, antisemitism, religious
   discrimination and intolerance, affecting Muslim, Arab, Jewish and
   other communities around the world".

Dangerous narratives

   Meanwhile, harmful narratives continue to thrive against migrants and
   refugees, evoking fear and racial superiority while fuelling racial
   discrimination, hatred and violence.

   "This hatred is often fed by political discourse, or by the media", the
   High Commissioner explained, saying that "toxic narratives destroy our
   social fabric...[and] destabilize our common values."

   She said that in times of peace as well as in conflict, authorities,
   politicians and the private sector bear "special responsibility" not to
   incite hatred, discrimination and violence, including in online.

   "All manifestations of racism must be immediately addressed and
   stopped".

Pick up the pace

   "We are moving too slowly," Ms. Bachelet told the meeting. "It is vital
   - and urgent - that we unite to accelerate the pace in the fight
   against racism and racialdiscrimination".

   Noting that the Durban PoA remains "more relevant than ever" in this
   fight, she underscored that States also need to honour their
   obligations and use international instruments to devise laws and
   policies that speak to racism and racialdiscrimination.

   "The newly established [74]Permanent Forum of People of African Descent
   will soon start operating and advise this Council on matters related to
   people of African descent," the High Commissioner said.

   It will also contribute to the drawing up of a UN declaration on
   promoting, protecting and fully respecting the human rights of people
   of African descent.

   She said that her office, [75]OHCHR's, [76]Four-point Agenda Towards
   Transformative Change for Racial Justice and Equality also provides a
   "number of important recommendations and a clear path for action."

Deliver reparatory justice

   The UN rights chief pushed for States to listen to those being
   discriminated against, stand up against racism in all its forms, and
   act on their concerns.

   "This cannot be a purely tokenistic effort," she said, describing as a
   "fundamental step" that activists and communities have meaningful,
   effective participation and representation "at all levels of
   decision-making" in the fight against racialdiscrimination.

   Furthermore, she continued, States and societies must address the
   legacy and consequences of racism and exclusion, including colonial
   exploitation, enslavement and the trade in enslaved Africans.

     It is time to deliver reparatory justice - UN rights chief

   "These crimes affected generations of women, men and children,
   stripping them of their humanity," Ms. Bachelet said, adding that "it
   is time to deliver reparatory justice".

Strength of diversity

   Only by embracing our differences can progress towards real change be
   made.

   "The [77]International Day for the Elimination of racialdiscrimination
   is observed to remind us of the horrors which racialdiscrimination can
   cause," she told the participants.

   Observing that "collective action is powerful action," she urged
   everyone to stand in solidarity with all victims.

   "Together, let's raise our voice and stand up against racism," the High
   Commissioner concluded. "Never again".

Daylight Saving Time sheds light on lack of sleep's disproportionate impact
in communities of color

   Explain it to me: Daylight Saving Time
   02:01 - Source: CNN
   CNN  --

   As the United States rolled back the clocks one hour this month to
   observe the [142]end of Daylight Saving Time, many people got a bit
   more sleep than usual - but some not as much as others.

   Growing evidence shows that lack of sleep and sleep disorders, such as
   obstructive sleep apnea, remain more prevalent in Black, Asian, and
   Hispanic or Latino communities, and these inequities can have long-term
   detrimental implications for physical health, even raising the risk of
   certain chronic diseases.

   Meanwhile, Daylight Saving Time itself - enacted in the US to reduce
   electricity usage by extending daylight hours - has long been
   controversial in the United States.
   A growing number of sleep experts say the act of moving our clocks
   forward for Daylight Savings Time in the spring is ruining our health.

   Permanent Daylight Saving Time will hurt our health, experts say

   The [143]American Academy of Sleep Medicine, the [144]Sleep Research
   Society and other medical groups have advocated for ending the
   practice, calling for the adoption of a permanent standard time that
   would not involve shifting forward each spring and falling back each
   autumn.

   "Daylight saving time is associated with increased risks of sleep loss,
   circadian misalignment, and adverse health consequences," Dr. Beth
   Malow, professor of neurology and pediatrics and director of the
   Vanderbilt University Medical Center Sleep Division in Nashville,
   [145]said in a news release this month. She authored a paper, published
   in September [146]in the journal Sleep, detailing the potential health
   benefits of adopting a permanent standard time.

   In March, the US Senate unanimously passed the [147]Sunshine Protection
   Act, which would make Daylight Saving Time permanent across the country
   - meaning there would be no reverting to "standard time" from early
   November through mid-March - but the legislation would have to pass the
   House and earn President Joe Biden's signature before becoming
   effective in November 2023.

   Now, some sleep researchers worry about the potential effects that
   continuing to change standard time twice each year may have on sleep
   health inequities.

   Why and when the US started changing the clock

   "Poor sleep is associated with a host of poor health outcomes,
   including obesity, hypertension, type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular
   disease and certain cancers, including of the breast and colon. Many of
   these health outcomes are more prevalent in the Black population," said
   Chandra Jackson, a researcher and epidemiologist with the National
   Institute of Environmental Health Sciences, who has been studying
   racial and ethnic disparities in sleep.

   "Experimental as well as observational studies have linked sleep to
   these health outcomes. Therefore, sleep could be an important
   contributor," she said. "Fortunately, sleep health is largely
   modifiable."

   As for the inequities seen in sleep health, it's not that White adults
   don't also experience a lack of sleep and its health consequences - but
   people of color appear to disproportionately experience them more, and
   that's believed to be largely due to social systems in the United
   States.

What sleep does to the body

   Sleep allows the body to restore itself on a cellular level. During
   quality sleep, your heart rate, blood pressure and breathing can rise
   and fall, which may be important for cardiovascular health, and your
   body releases hormones that help repair cells and control its use of
   energy, according to the [148]National Institutes of Health. These
   hormone changes also can influence your weight.

   A study published in October in the journal PLOS Medicine suggests that
   people 50 and older who [149]sleep five hours or less at night have a
   higher risk of multiple chronic diseases as they age compared with
   peers who get a longer night's rest.

   Separate research, also published in October in the journal of the
   American Heart Association, shows that [150]cardiovascular health
   guidelines are more effective at predicting a person's risk of heart
   disease if they include sleep - and not focus solely on diet and
   exercise.

   How to best prepare for time change

   Certain [151]physiologic processes - such as immune function,
   cardiovascular health and memory formation - require certain amounts of
   sleep. So without enough sleep, the body and brain may not function
   optimally, said Dr. C?sar Caraballo-Cordovez, a postdoctoral associate
   in the Yale-based Center for Outcomes Research and Evaluation who has
   [152]studied racial and ethnic disparities in sleep duration.

   "Short sleep duration has been associated with higher risk of adverse
   medical events and conditions, including diabetes, obesity,
   hypertension, heart disease, impaired cognitive functions, and death,"
   Caraballo-Cordovez wrote in an email, adding that the consensus is that
   most adults need at least seven hours of sleep per day.

   Yet the racial and ethnic disparities in sleep duration appear to be
   getting worse across the United States, according to recent research by
   Caraballo-Cordovez, Jackson and their colleagues. Their study,
   published in April in the medical journal [153]JAMA Network Open, found
   that among more than 400,000 adults in the US, between 2004 and 2018,
   the prevalence of short and long sleep duration was persistently higher
   among those who were Black and Hispanic or Latino. Short sleep is less
   than seven hours in a day, and long sleep is more than nine hours.

   Although there was a significant increase in the prevalence of
   insufficient sleep across all groups during the study period, the
   prevalence of short sleep increased 6.39 and 6.61 percentage points
   among Black and Hispanic or Latino adults, respectively, compared with
   3.22 percentage points among White people.

   Several social and environmental factors that can interfere with sleep
   are more common among Black and Hispanic or Latino people in the US,
   Caraballo-Cordovez said.

   "Among those are housing conditions, noise pollution, light pollution,
   air pollution, stress from different sources - including perceived
   racialdiscrimination - and jobs or working conditions," he said,
   adding that the convergence of all those factors may explain why
   getting the recommended amount of sleep "may be less common among Black
   adults than among White adults."

   Caraballo-Cordovez and Jackson both emphasize that the causes behind
   the racial inequality of sleep warrant more research.

The `persistent barriers' to quality sleep

   Many social and environmental determinants of health - including living
   conditions or work schedules that don't support sleep - may emerge, at
   least in part, from historical and persistent forms of structural
   racism, which Jackson considers as the "totality of ways in which
   societies foster racialdiscrimination through mutually reinforcing
   systems of housing, education, employment, wages, benefits, credit,
   media, health care and criminal justice."

   These variables affect whether you live, die or get help during the
   pandemic

   Jackson added that she often reflects on how[154] the shooting death of
   Breonna Taylor in Louisville in March 2020 and the [155]shooting of
   George Floyd's 4-year-old grandniece in Houston on New Year's Day both
   happened when they were asleep - and how systems of structural racism
   in the US can cultivate conditions that make such incidents more likely
   to happen in Black communities. "This would require research," she
   said.

   Examples of structural racism and how they can have impacts on health
   include the history of discriminatory mortgage lending and
   [156]appraisals in the US, which affect the conditions in which people
   of color may live; how predominantly white school districts [157]tend
   to get more funding than districts serving people of color, influencing
   the quality of education some people of color may receive; and even how
   hair discrimination may contribute to some Black women using
   [158]potentially harmful chemical hair products because policies might
   not allow specific hairstyles in school or the workplace.

   "These policies and practices can produce disparities due to the
   maldistribution of health-promoting or harming resources across racial
   groups and can, in turn, reinforce discriminatory beliefs," Jackson
   said. "That is, it is believed that discriminatory policies and
   practices across sectors of society create the physical and social
   conditions that make it more difficult for Black families to get
   optimal sleep and grow up healthy. Fortunately, these policies and
   practices are also modifiable."

   Although more research on the causes of disparities in sleep is needed,
   she said, essentially anything that produces physical and psychological
   stress is a threat to sleep health, and these stressors tend to be more
   prevalent in Black communities.

   In the US Department of Health and Human Services' [160]Healthy People
   2030 plan for the nation, improving health by helping people get enough
   sleep was listed as a goal, with objectives including increasing the
   proportion of adults with sleep apnea symptoms getting evaluated by a
   health care provider and increasing the proportion of schools that
   start later in the mornings. Improving sleep health has been a national
   objective in the federal government's past two Healthy People programs,
   noted Caraballo-Cordovez, who is not involved in the programs.

   But he added that "the impact of strategies focused on improving sleep
   knowledge and habits - although important and necessary - may be
   limited if they do not address the persistent barriers that
   disproportionally prevent Black individuals from achieving and
   maintaining a healthy life."

Still rigged: racism in the UK labour market

   Report type
   Research and reports
   Issue date
   31 Aug 2022
   Foreword

   This important and sobering report lifts the lid on racism in our
   labour market. Based on extensive polling, it provides quantitative
   evidence of the scale of workplace discrimination facing Black [19]1
   workers. And it offers an insight into the insidious way in which this
   racism undermines their lives, livelihoods, and life chances.

   Carried out under the auspices of our Anti-Racism Taskforce, the TUC's
   research shows that racism scars every aspect of working life. As well
   as determining who gets hired and fired, it also shapes Black workers'
   day-to-day experiences, from training and promotion opportunities to
   the allocation of shifts and holidays. Many BME workers also told us
   they have experienced bullying, harassment and worse. Alarmingly, the
   vast majority did not report this to their employer.

   Unsurprisingly, all this comes at a huge cost. Black workers' mental
   health suffers. Their confidence takes a hit. And many suffer in-work
   poverty, sometimes having to do two, or even three, jobs to make ends
   meet. This racism doesn't just wreck lives - it's used to divide
   working people and makes us all weaker.

   As the global struggle for racial justice has intensified, race
   equality has become prominent on the political agenda. The Covid-19
   pandemic highlighted inequalities hardwired into our economy and
   society, with BME workers more likely to do dangerous work, more likely
   to contract the virus and more likely to die from it. We know too that
   Black workers are on the frontline of insecure work, being massively
   over-represented on zero-hours contracts and in low-paid jobs. And this
   makes them especially vulnerable to the cost-of-living emergency now
   hammering working people.

   This study underlines the overwhelming need for change. Despite
   commissioning report after report on race equality, the government has
   consistently failed to deliver the reforms we need. Instead of
   addressing the causes and consequences of discrimination, ministers
   have chosen to pursue dangerous narratives about race that divide
   working people.

   That's why unions must put the fight against racism at the heart of our
   organising, bargaining and campaigning work. We must build solidarity
   among working people, showing that the debates about class and race in
   modern Britain are fundamentally linked. And we must lead by example
   and meet the aspirations of our Black members for better work. As this
   research makes clear, many had a positive experience of homeworking
   during the pandemic, underlining why we need genuine flexibility for
   all.

   But unions can't do it all alone. This report ought to act as a wake-up
   call for employers, policymakers and politicians. The scale of the
   challenge we face demands structural, institutional and legislative
   change. And where better to start than by introducing mandatory
   Ethnicity Pay Gap Reporting - alongside Action Plans to address
   discrepancies?

   Now is not the time for incremental measures or half-hearted policy
   initiatives, but for transformative change. The trade union movement
   will keep fighting for radical action to address racism in our labour
   market. We believe Britain at work should be Britain at its best -
   fair, inclusive and equal. Black workers deserve nothing less.

   Frances O'Grady, TUC General Secretary
     * [20]1 The TUC uses the term `Black workers' to indicate people of
       colour with a shared history. `Black' is used in a broad political
       and inclusive sense to describe people in the UK who have suffered
       from colonialism and enslavement in the past and continue to
       experience racism and diminished opportunities.

   Please note this report includes racist comments shared with us by
   focus group participants to illustrate their experiences of everyday
   racism. These may trigger unwelcome and distressing memories or
   thoughts for some readers. Resources for support can be found at the
   end of this report.

Executive Summary

   Racism does not exist in a vacuum. It is multi-faceted, multi-layered
   and emerges from established values and practices that are deeply
   embedded within our institutions and structures. Often workplace racism
   is wrongly reduced to either a series of random one-off events and/ or
   the implicit attitudes and unconscious biases of an individual. The
   findings of this report remind us that racism remains a critical
   feature of workplace structures and culture and everyday working life
   for a significant number of people in this country.

   We must recognise and address the fact that racist ideas and racial
   inequality in the labour market rely on a series of everyday workplace
   practices for their reproduction. The types of racism that are referred
   to in this report are `everyday racism' (also referred to as individual
   racism), institutional racism and structural racism.

   Everyday racism describes recurrent, systemic, and familiar practices
   within society that work to the detriment of BME people. It can consist
   of `banter' and being marked out as being different from other dominant
   groups at work. It can consist of everyday slights, snubs or insults
   that can make us feel unwelcome, second-class or stereotyped.

   Following the Stephen Lawrence Inquiry in 1999[21]2 , institutional
   racism in the UK was defined as "the collective failure of an
   organisation to provide an appropriate and professional service to
   people because of their colour, culture, or ethnic origin. It can be
   seen or detected in processes, attitudes and behaviour which amount to
   discrimination through unwitting prejudice, ignorance, thoughtlessness,
   and racial stereotyping which disadvantage minority ethnic people."

   Structural racism refers to wider political and social disadvantage and
   affects individuals daily. Racism is a system of domination and
   oppression with a deep-rooted historical foundation. It divides and
   organises society in a way that structurally disadvantages certain
   ethnic groups. For example, consider the fact that BME households have
   higher rates of poverty[22]3  or the high rates of death from Covid-19
   among BME groups.[23]4

   To paint a contemporary picture of BME people's experiences of racism
   at work, the TUC commissioned Number Cruncher Politics to carry out
   polling on experiences of

   discrimination in the UK, the impact of the pandemic - including
   working from home - on BME workers, and what BME workers think of
   employer action on tackling racism. The polling is based on a weighted
   sample of 1,750 Black and Ethnic Minority workers in the UK, which we
   believe is the largest representative poll ever carried out to look at
   the experiences of BME people at work.

   We asked people to tell us about their experiences at work: if they had
   been racially harassed, attacked or bullied, if they had been treated
   differently by their employer because of their race (e.g., by being
   denied promotion, access to training or being unfairly disciplined). We
   also asked people to tell us about their experiences of raising issues
   of racism in the workplace; how their employers responded to their
   complaint, what support they were able to get and what impact the
   experience of workplace racism had on their lives outside of work.

   The evidence captured in this report reveals the systemic nature of
   racism and highlights that workplace racism and racial inequality must
   be addressed through substantive structural, institutional and
   legislative reform.

   The findings reveal both the structural racism that traps Black workers
   in lower paid and insecure jobs, and the everyday experience of racism.
   Almost one in five BME workers (18 per cent) had to work two or more
   jobs for financial reasons. 15 per cent have worked on a zero-hours
   contract at some point in the past five years and a similar proportion
   (13 per cent) have had working hours changed at short notice.

   Two in five BME workers reported experiencing racism at work in the
   last five years. Those who reported experiencing at least one form of
   harassment were asked to think back to the most recent incident.Over
   half believe that their treatment was at least partly due to their race
   or ethnic background.

   In terms of everyday racism, BME workers were asked to select all types
   of harassment that they have experienced at work in the past five
   years.

   The most common responses were:
     * racist jokes or banter (27 per cent)
     * being made to feel uncomfortable at work due to, for example,
       people using stereotypes or commenting on their appearance (26 per
       cent)
     * being bullied or harassed (21 per cent)
     * racist remarks directed at them or made in their presence (21 per
       cent)

   Incidents of racism and discrimination have a clear negative impact on
   BME workers. Around a third reported that the most recent incident left
   them feeling less confident at work (35 per cent), and a similar
   proportion said it made them feel embarrassed (34 per cent) and had a
   negative impact on their mental health (31 per cent).

   The vast majority of those subjected to harassment do not tell their
   employer. Only 19 per cent of those who had experienced harassment
   reported the most recent incident to their employer. Those subjected to
   harassment were more likely to tell their family or friends (41 per
   cent), a work colleague (34 per cent), or do nothing (24 per cent).
   Only six per cent told their trade union - although this does rise to
   20 per cent among trade union members.

   Reporting an incident to an employer, in the majority of instances,
   doesn't lead to action being taken to prevent future harassment. Action
   was taken to prevent harassment in just 29 per cent of cases, and in 24
   per cent of cases, no action was taken. 44 per cent of those who had
   experienced harassment but didn't report it said they didn't think the
   issue would be taken seriously. These findings are a clear example of
   how institutional racism manifests in workplaces across the UK.

   Racism is part of the fabric of British society, its insidious
   operations and deep institutionalisation means that for centuries it
   has been operating at varying degrees and levels. The experiences
   shared with us by BME workers and the polling data on racism in the
   labour market reinforces this. There is an urgent need to effectively
   tackle racism and achieve a significant and sustained change in
   workplace culture. Key to the change needed is one of mindset. Too
   often, racism is only seen as a problem when an individual incident is
   identified - such as when someone gets abused or are treated
   differently because of their race.

   What is needed instead is a collective, pre-emptive response that
   promotes equality and dignity for everyone, gives confidence to all
   staff that they need not stand for discrimination or bullying, and
   makes dealing with racism at work everyone's responsibility. To achieve
   this change, government, employers, enforcement bodies and trade unions
   must work together to:
     * Ensure that the workers at the sharp end of structural racism get a
       better deal. Black workers are significantly more likely to
       experience insecure and poor-quality work. Raising the floor of
       rights for everyone will have a disproportionately positive impact
       on Black workers and make it harder for employers to operate a
       two-tier workforce.
     * Ensure that employers have a duty to embed race equality practices
       in their workplaces. Employers should be responsible for taking
       corrective and preventative action. They must ensure that they take
       measurable steps to prevent situations in which their employees are
       at risk of encountering everyday and institutional racism.
     * Ensure that there are swift and effective penalties when workers
       experience racism.  Everyone deserves to be treated with respect
       and dignity at work. All forms of alleged harassment and bullying
       must be dealt with seriously and swiftly.

Introduction

   The murder of George Floyd on 25 May 2020 in Minneapolis, Minnesota
   reignited the Black Lives Matter (BLM) movement in the USA and forced a
   public discussion about the nature of racism in society globally. The
   Black Lives Matters protest in the UK - most notably highlighted by the
   toppling of the statue of the slave trader Edward Colston in July 2020-
   challenged the national historical narrative about Britain's
   involvement in slavery, colonialism, and Empire and how this links to
   contemporary race discrimination in the UK. This discussion has been
   largely absent from recent public debate and was last prominent during
   the early and mid-2000s in the context of the war on terror.

   The impact of disproportionate levels of death experienced by Black
   workers during the coronavirus pandemic shone a spotlight on the
   entrenched institutional racism experienced by Black communities.
   Covid-19 unveiled a pandemic of inequalities rife within BME
   communities. From the over-policing of Black communities, to the
   creeping realisation that because BME people are significantly more
   likely to live in poverty, they were at greater risk of overcrowding
   and therefore faced increased risk of contracting coronavirus.[24]5

   The current broader right-wing political developments and media
   discourses have legitimised and normalised racism, xenophobia, and
   anti-immigrant sentiment. This discourse plays a destructive role in
   shaping the forms of racism people continue to encounter in their
   everyday working lives. Numerous reports produced over the years - some
   commissioned by the government- have recommended action to tackle
   institutional racism and entrenched disadvantage. If these
   recommendations had been acted on, BME workers would perhaps not have
   suffered the disproportionate number of deaths during this crisis.

   The government's response to date has failed to accept the extent to
   which institutional racism plays a part in the lived experiences of
   Black workers in the labour market. Indeed, the government's own
   Commission on Race and Ethnic Disparities attempted to roll back the
   conclusions of Sir Robert Macpherson's report into the murder of
   Stephen Lawrence by denying that institutional racism exists.

   And `Inclusive Britain', the 2022 government response to the report of
   the Commission on Race and Ethnic Disparities, fails to address the
   fundamental issues of race discrimination faced by Black workers in the
   labour market. Its only response to the problems of racial
   discrimination in the workplace is to a commitment to publish advice
   for employers who may want to introduce ethnic pay gap reporting. It
   fails to address the daily racism faced by Black workers. Previous TUC
   research[25]6  has shown that Black workers are: -
     * More likely to be disciplined
     * More likely to have low scores on performance appraisals
     * More likely to be given the more challenging and less popular tasks
     * More likely to be unfairly criticised
     * More likely to suffer harassment or violence
     * More likely to be bullied
     * Less likely to get access to training
     * Less likely to be given development opportunities or be allowed to
       act up to a senior level
     * Less likely to get access to promotion

   A core problem with the government's response to racism overall is that
   it fails to recognise that whilst workers from different ethnic groups
   may have different experiences in the workplace, this does not mean
   they do not have a shared experience of racism. These different
   experiences result from class, historical and contemporary migration
   patterns into the UK which have resulted in occupational segregation.
   Continuing racial stereotyping of different groups reinforces this
   segregation.

   Racism clearly shapes the type of jobs people have access to, and the
   pay they receive when they do those jobs. For example, recent TUC
   research shows us that one in six (14.6 per cent) of Black and Minority
   Ethnic workers are likely to be in insecure work, compared to 11.15 per
   cent of White workers in this position.[26]7  Ministers have ignored
   the growth in casualisation suffered by Black workers who are
   disproportionately trapped in temporary jobs, agency jobs and
   zero-hours contracts. This trend has resulted in high levels of in-work
   poverty, resulting in Black workers being trapped in low-waged
   occupations and in situations where they are expected to do the most
   demanding and dangerous work.

   The TUC believes that the economic position of people in Black
   communities, the racism that shapes their lived experience and the role
   that race inequality plays in the world of work, as the pandemic
   demonstrated, needs urgent addressing.

   Racism can determine who gets hired, trained, promoted, retained,
   demoted, and dismissed. The evidence presented in this report further
   demonstrates that it is wrong to dismiss talk of racism and racial
   inequality. The structuring role of racism is such that it shapes the
   class position, class experience and class relations between workers
   and employers. Racism plays an important role in explaining why people
   racialised as non-White are more likely to find themselves in low-paid,
   non-permanent, low-hours jobs.

   But the impact of racism doesn't stop at job selection or pay. Black
   workers experience everyday racism, which both damages their mental
   health, acts to reinforce their marginalisation within workplaces, and
   damages their chances of getting on.

   In commissioning this report, the TUC's Anti-Racism Taskforce seeks to
   ensure that the voices of Black workers are heard and that their daily
   experience informs the actions that must be taken to tackle racism in
   the workplace. If these experiences are ignored, then, as in the past,
   the policies and practices implemented will not result in the scale of
   change we need.

Research methodology - Focus groups and polling

   In early 2021 Number Cruncher Politics conducted four focus group
   interviews of BME workers active in the labour market. The four groups
   were demographically and geographically segmented and consisted of:
     * BME women - above the age of 40 - London
     * BME women - under 40 - non-London
     * BME men - under 40 - London
     * BME men - above the age of 40 - non-London

   In 2022, Number Cruncher Politics followed up this research with
   polling on BME workers. The polling is based on a weighted sample of
   1,750 Black and Ethnic Minority workers in the UK. Interviews were
   completed online between 1 February and 1 May 2022.

   The sample frame was BME adults aged 18 to 64, UK-wide, whose ILO
   economic activity was employed (including self-employed) or unemployed
   having previously worked, and who were not currently in full-time
   education. This population is young, urban, and highly educated. Among
   them 66 per cent were under-45, 41 per cent live in London, 61 per cent
   have higher education (NVQ level 4+), and 65 per cent were born outside
   the UK. The ethnic breakdown was 54 per cent Asian, 24 per cent Black,
   11 per cent Mixed Race, and 12 per cent Other ethnicities.

   Polling of BME populations presents a number of challenges. It is
   rarely done, and samples have historically tended to overrepresent
   those who are more affluent, better integrated, UK-born rather than
   immigrants, and specific ethnic groups. This has made it difficult to
   research the views of BME Britain, and in turn has contributed to an
   information vacuum, which work, such as this, seeks to address. Number
   Cruncher has done considerable work to achieve representative samples
   of the UK's BME communities - in this case, the BME workforce
   specifically.

   In part, this involves many of the same considerations applicable to
   general population polling under real world conditions, such as
   properly representing younger respondents, those in urban areas and
   those less interested in politics and current affairs. But it also
   involves specific consideration of the harder-to-reach sections of BME
   communities, and the often-complex demographic and other biases
   traditionally found when polling them.

   Number Cruncher's online sampling is designed to avoid or reduce these
   biases in raw samples as far as possible. This is done by using a
   mixture of online sampling outside of traditional survey panels,
   together with vetting the panels used, to ensure high sample quality.
   Where necessary, remaining biases are removed via quotas and weights.
   This is done either directly (education, country of birth, and so on)
   or indirectly via geography.

Everyday racism at work

   Everyday racism at work can involve being a victim of racial comments
   and jokes - sometimes inexplicit jokes that have deep rooted undertones
   of racial stereotypes and prejudice. Over time, these experiences build
   up and can lead to under-confidence, have detrimental impact on mental
   health and damage positive social relations at work. Everyday racism
   can also consist of overtly racist language directed at BME people and
   even physical assault.

   2 in 5 BME workers reported experiencing racism at work in the last
   five years. BME workers were asked to select all types of harassment
   that they have experienced at work in the past five years. The most
   common responses were:
     * racist jokes or banter (27 per cent)
     * being made to feel uncomfortable at work due to, for example,
       people using stereotypes or commenting on appearance (26 per cent)
     * being bullied, or harassed (21 per cent)
     * racist remarks directed at you or made in your presence (21 per
       cent).

   There were some differences by gender, with BME men being more likely
   to have experienced racist jokes or banter than women (30 per cent to
   24 per cent), to have experienced verbal abuse or seen it happen to
   others (22 per cent to 16 per cent) and to have witnessed racist verbal
   or physical abuse of others at work or at work-organised social events
   (22 per cent compared to 18 per cent). BME women are more likely to
   have been excluded from workplace related social events (16 per cent to
   12 per cent).

   Young BME workers (18-24) were significantly more likely to experience
   racist jokes or banter (40 per cent compared to 27 per cent among all
   BME workers). In general, young BME workers were more likely to have
   experienced each type of harassment, with the exception of being
   excluded from work related meetings or conversations.

   Young BME workers were almost twice as likely as any other age group to
   have seen racist literature or music distributed in the workplace (20
   per cent, compared to 11 per cent of those aged 25-34, 7 per cent of
   those aged 35-44, 6 per cent of those aged 45-54 and 0 per cent of
   those aged 55-64).

What happened after the most recent incident?

   Those who reported experiencing at least one form of harassment were
   asked to think back to the most recent incident. Over half believe that
   their treatment was at least partly due to their race or ethnic
   background.

   The most common perpetrator of harassment was a colleague (38 per
   cent). In one in six instances (17 per cent), the perpetrator was a
   direct manager or someone else with direct authority. In 15 per cent of
   cases, the perpetrator was a customer, client, or patient. Given that
   BME workers make up just 14% of the workforce[38]8 , 'These findings
   demonstrate the prevalence of racism at work - and how that determines
   who is deemed to belong, and on what terms.

   Such incidents have a clear negative impact on BME workers:
     * Around a third reported that the most recent incident left them
       feeling less confident at work (35 per cent)
     * 34 per cent said it made them feel embarrassed
     * 31 per cent said it had a negative impact on their mental health.
     * Around a quarter (26 per cent) of those who have experienced
       harassment said the most recent incident had left them wanting to
       leave their job, but financial or other factors made it impossible
       to do so.

Reporting an incident

   The vast majority of those subjected to harassment do not tell their
   employer. Only 19 per cent of those who have experienced harassment
   reported the most recent incident to their employer. Those subjected to
   harassment are more likely to tell their family or friends (41 per
   cent), a work colleague (34 per cent), or do nothing (24 per cent).
   Only 6 per cent told their trade union - although this does rise to 20
   per cent among trade union members.

   Of those who did report an incident to an employer only 38 per cent
   were satisfied, and 48 per cent were dissatisfied with how it was
   handled. Reporting an incident to an employer, in the majority of
   instances, didn't lead to action being taken to prevent future
   harassment. Action was taken to prevent future harassment in only 29
   per cent of cases, and in 24 per cent of cases, no action was taken.

   A quarter of cases resulted in a formal investigation (24 per cent) and
   15 per cent led to informal investigation. 17 per cent saw disciplinary
   action taken against the perpetrator, and 9 per cent saw some other
   type of action taken against the perpetrator. Some of those who
   reported incidents received negative treatment as a result: 7 per cent
   were transferred to another department or workplace, 3 per cent were
   disciplined and 3 per cent were subject to a counter complaint.

   Of those who did report the incident to their employer:
     * 59 per cent said they were treated better by their employer as a
       result
     * 31 per cent said there was no change
     * 7 per cent said it made their treatment worse

   Of those incidents reported to employers:
     * 19 per cent of complaints were ignored and 7 per cent weren't
       believed
     * Only a third (32 per cent) were formally investigated
     * Only one in five were dealt with fairly (19 per cent), dealt with
       promptly (21 per cent) or taken seriously (20 per cent)

   The polling also looks at why people don't report incidents of
   harassment to their employer. The most common reasons given for not
   reporting the most recent incident of harassment are:
     * I didn't think the issue would be taken seriously (44 per cent of
       those who had experienced harassment but didn't report it)
     * I was worried about the impact on my working relationship with
       colleagues (26 per cent)
     * I had no confidence that the incident would be addressed (20 per
       cent)
     * I thought I would be treated worse by my employer if I reported (19
       per cent)

   The BME workers we interviewed in our focus groups similarly described
   their experiences of everyday racism at work. Some have stated that
   their employers get them "confused" with other BME colleagues which
   makes them feel like they are seen as one bloc rather than as
   individuals, and ultimately can lead to feeling isolated and invisible
   at work. Others stated how their names have been mispronounced and
   spelt incorrectly. They noted that if they were to bring these issues,
   they fear being labelled as a "troublemaker".

   The survey participants who opted not to report the incident of
   harassment they had faced to their employer may have done so because
   they were all too aware of how it can negatively impact their treatment
   at work, and/or limit further opportunities.

"When I go into a class, for example, of the first thing that the children
asked me is 'Miss Where are you from?' because I don't have a British
accent."

"My name is not an English name therefore, because it has a 'q', it doesn't
by default have to have a 'u' in there, which is what English people seem to
think. If it was the other way around and you decided to misspell their name
on every occasion, I'm sure it would get to a point where it will start
bothering them as well."

   Experiences of everyday racism, such as microaggressions, need to be
   integrated within the larger picture of racism which operates in the
   UK. Much contemporary racism is tied to the unaddressed underpinnings
   of the British state, such as slavery, colonialism and nationalism,
   which have allowed racism to flourish. Ignoring the history of racism
   in the UK feeds into its proliferation. When these instances of
   everyday racism remain unchallenged, they threaten to further embed
   structural racism. We therefore cannot be passive when it comes to
   confronting racist thinking and actions.

"My colleague made a statement to the effect of, 'it wouldn't happen like
that in your country, would it?'"

"[They say] stuff like `black monkey, go back to your country'"

   Racist bullying and harassment are a constant part of BME workers
   experiences of everyday racism at work. Sometimes this is directed at
   them by their managers and colleagues and other times by customers or
   students. If workplace racism is to be taken seriously, senior leaders
   must ensure that they instil a zero-tolerance approach to workplace
   racism across the organisation and consistently across managerial
   structures.

"I ended up being on long term sick leave because I couldn't deal with her
[manager] mood swings because I didn't know how she would be from day-to-day.
She was intimidating me in front of other colleagues, she would be shouting
across the office to me. She said morning to everyone, and not even
acknowledge me."

   Not being taken seriously, being ignored, and being seen as a
   "troublemaker" for raising complaints about racism only further
   compounds the effect of the original racist experience on the victim.
   This further increases the impact that racism has on people's physical
   and mental health, resulting in them feeling more isolated. This can
   also lead to victims being forced out of the job or leaving their job
   as a result.

   BME people from different ethnicities, genders and faiths have varying
   experiences of racism. Everyday racist experiences can be intersected
   with misogynist, classist, homophobic, ableist, biphobic, transphobic,
   antisemitic and Islamophobic slurs. Individuals facing multiple forms
   of discrimination are often seen as `easier' targets, and often lack
   power in the workplace. For example, a recent report highlighted that
   75 per cent of BME women have experienced racism at work.[41]9
   Although each experience is unique and tied to the identity of an
   individual, it is also important to recognise they are all united by
   shared experiences of racism.

"[My manager] would just treat me differently compared to the other people
because I was Asian, so her behaviour was different. And every time I was
doing well at my job, she would just decrease my salary, so I was earning
less."

   The racist remarks and ignorant questioning that BME people face at
   work are shaped by broader political and media narratives. In this case
   above, the xenophobia and anti-immigrant sentiment is hard to ignore.

   The findings in this report strongly suggest that we need to start
   thinking about workplace racism as a health and safety issue.
   Participants in both the polling and focus groups have reported the
   impact of racism on their mental health and have noted having to
   undergo periods of sick leave. Some respondents even felt compelled to
   leave their job as a direct result of the impact that racism had on
   their emotional and mental well-being.

   Failing to address these experiences erases the plight of BME people at
   work. Racist experiences may lead to BME people thinking less of
   themselves, leading them to feel marginalised at work and have
   increased problems with their mental health, while perpetrators of
   racism will more likely feel emboldened by their actions and further
   strengthen their ideas of racial superiority - whether it is intended
   or "unconscious". Workplace racism can have devastating impacts and can
   lead to people giving up careers, having to take cuts in pay and having
   to seek other employment.

Structural racism in employment

   BME workers are more likely to live in areas with little investment
   from government, and high levels of concentrated poverty with
   overcrowded conditions.[42]10 This is compounded by the insecure and
   underpaid conditions these workers face in the labour market. Racism is
   not only a problem when specific incidents of racism take place. We
   must acknowledge the cumulative effect of institutional racism on BME
   workers' health, wellbeing, and ability to get on at work.

   Structural and institutional racism means BME workers face a lower
   employment rate and a higher unemployment rate than White workers.
   Alongside this, BME workers are also more likely to be in insecure work
   than White workers. While the employment rate for BME workers has
   improved over the past decade, it remains significantly below the
   employment rate for White workers (68.3 per cent compared to 77.0 per
   cent).[43]11

   This is especially true for BME women. The employment rate for BME
   women has increased by almost 13 per cent over the past decade, yet it
   remains substantially below the employment rate for White men (61.7 per
   cent compared to 79.5 per cent). A recent report by the Fawcett Society
   found that 28 per cent of BME women (compared to 19 per cent of White
   women) reported that a manager had blocked their progression at work,
   whilst 42 per cent reported being passed over for promotion despite
   good feedback.[50]12  The road to progression for BME workers is
   littered with obstacles, and the lack of transparency and fair
   recruitment processes into senior roles plays a key part. Given this,
   it is unsurprising that such deeply entrenched discrimination directly
   impacts the physical and mental health of BME people.[51]13

   BME workers are overrepresented in the lowest paid occupations and
   underrepresented in the highest paid occupations.[55]14

   Black workers[56]15  are:
     * 32 per cent more likely to work in `caring, leisure and other
       service occupations'
     * 28 per cent more likely to work in `elementary occupations', which
       are primarily cleaning
     * 22 per cent less likely to work as managers, directors or senior
       officials
     * 42 per cent less likely to work in skilled trades occupations

   Black women[57]17 are:
     * 12 per cent more likely to work in `caring, leisure and other
       service occupations'
     * 24 per cent less likely to work as managers, directors or senior
       officials

Unemployment rates

   The unemployment rate for BME workers is persistently higher than the
   unemployment rate for White workers. Since current records began in
   2001, the lowest the percentage gap between the two unemployment rates
   has been 69 per cent. On average, across the twenty-year period, the
   BME unemployment rate has been 110 per cent higher (over double) the
   White unemployment rate.

   In terms of unemployment, the pandemic hit BME workers much harder than
   White workers. BME workers remain significantly more likely than White
   workers to experience unemployment whatever the economic environment.
   And unemployment trends during the pandemic bore this out: the
   unemployment rate for BME workers rose to 9.8 per cent in Q4 2020
   compared to 4.5 per cent for White workers.  BME women were
   particularly hard hit by the pandemic, with the unemployment rate for
   BME women hitting 10.9 per cent in the same quarter.

   And BME workers did not enjoy the same speed of recovery in
   unemployment rates that White workers did. A year later, in Q4 2021,
   the unemployment rate for White workers had recovered to pre-pandemic
   levels. In contrast, the unemployment rate for BME workers remained 1.9
   percentage points higher. [58]18

   The BME unemployment rate has fallen back to its pre-pandemic level in
   the most recent data (for Q2 2022), but BME workers were clearly hit
   harder and for longer by the pandemic. And it's worth noting that the
   unemployment rate for BME workers remains almost twice as high as it is
   for White workers.[65]19

   Previous TUC analysis has looked at the impact of the pandemic on BME
   employment.[66]20  It seems that rising unemployment during the
   pandemic has been driven not necessarily by job losses among BME
   workers, but more BME people trying to enter the labour market but not
   managing to find jobs.

Experiences of work: hours, living costs and security

   In our polling, we asked BME workers about their experiences of work in
   the last five years. The findings show us that workplaces play a
   critical role in sustaining and reproducing structural racism.
     * Almost one in five BME workers (18 per cent) had to work two or
       more jobs for financial reasons.
     * 15 per cent have worked on a zero-hours contract at some point in
       the past five years.
     * 15 per cent have struggled to earn enough to afford basic living
       costs.
     * 9 per cent have not received sick pay when off work sick.
     * 9 per cent have been made redundant at some point in the past five
       years

Progression, working tasks and unfair criticism and scrutiny

   Feeling marginalised, pigeon-holed into specific tasks, or taken
   advantage of is a common experience for many BME workers. For example,
   BME workers being assigned less popular shifts (night-time, unsociable
   hours) than their White colleagues, unequal distribution of labour and
   holding BME workers more accountable than their White peers.[67]21

   When asked about unfair criticism and scrutiny in the workplace, one in
   seven BME workers reported facing unfair criticism (14 per cent) in the
   last five years. 8 per cent report being unfairly disciplined, and 7
   per cent have been subjected to excessive surveillance or
   scrutiny. This demonstrates how racism instils precarity for BME people
   in the workplace.

   More than one in ten BME workers' experience of work is also affected
   by being denied promotions (12 per cent) and having requests for
   training turned down and development opportunities denied (9 per
   cent). The allocation of tasks and work is also an issue, with 12 per
   cent of BME workers reporting being given harder or less popular work
   tasks, and one in ten saying they are not offered overtime. A similar
   proportion (9 per cent) say that they have not been given sufficient
   working hours.

   One focus group participant described how racism and xenophobia
   impacted them:

"She handed me the child's book and I said `no, don't give it to me. Give it
to the teaching assistant when she comes in,' and she didn't like that, and
she just flung the book at my face. I'm not one of those very, kind of loud
and aggressive people and so she felt that, 'oh she's just this little woman
from India, she hasn't got a British accent, she's qualified from overseas.'"

   Anti-immigrant sentiment often forms the basis of racist abuse facing
   BME workers. This does not exist in a vacuum. Indeed, in recent years
   we have been reminded time and time again, how decades of unrelenting
   immigration policies, nationality laws and media narratives have
   created and embedded a hostile environment for ethnic minority people
   in the UK.

Flexibility, care responsibilities and support for Disabled workers

   A core way in which the post-pandemic workplace is changing is the
   desire of many workers for more flexible forms of work - and our
   research shows BME workers are no exception. And of course, more
   flexible work has long been needed to support parents, especially
   women, and Disabled workers to remain in the labour market. TUC
   research has shown that there is a real appetite among workers for a
   range of flexible working options. Our research shows more than four
   out of five (82 per cent) workers in the UK want to work flexibly in
   the future, rising to 87 per cent amongst women workers.[74]22 Recent
   ONS data also noted how individuals reported the main advantage of
   homeworking being "an improvement to work-life balance".[75]23

   Our polling asked BME workers about their experience of flexible work
   and managing work alongside caring responsibilities.
     * 14 per cent of BME workers have had a request for flexible working
       refused.
     * 15 per cent of respondents said they had experienced difficulties
       managing work alongside childcare, and around 4 per cent said they
       have experienced being singled out for unfair treatment because of
       having children.
     * 5 per cent of BME workers have not received the support they needed
       for a disability, impairment, or health condition after illness.
     * A similar proportion (4 per cent) have not received the support
       needed to return to work after being off due to an impairment, or
       health condition.[76]24

       responsibilities or Disabled workers.

   Black workers are more likely to work in jobs and industries where
   access to home working is limited. That's why we must ensure fair
   access to all types of flexible working. Flexibility is not only home
   working but also includes winning shift predictability, flexible start
   and finish times, job-sharing and proper time off for caring
   responsibilities.

Insecure work

   BME workers are also more likely than White workers to be in insecure
   work. BME workers, especially BME women, are more likely to be employed
   on zero-hours contracts (ZHC).

   BME employees are also more likely than White employees to be employed
   on temporary contracts. 10.3 per cent of BME employees were in
   temporary employment in Q4 2021, compared to 5.5 per cent of White
   employees. This has grown over the past two years, from 7.9 per cent of
   BME employees and 4.8 per cent of White employees in Q4 2019.[82]25
     * [83]25 Ibid

   8

   Each year, the TUC estimates the number of people in insecure work.
   When estimating the number of people in insecure work the TUC includes:
     * those on zero-hours contracts
     * agency, casual and seasonal workers (but not those on fixed - term
       contracts)
     * the low-paid self-employed who miss out on key rights and
       protections that come with being an employee and cannot afford to
       provide a safety net for when they are unable to work.

   The most recent analysis found that BME workers are far more likely
   than White workers to be in insecure work.[84]26 Nearly one in six
   (15.7 per cent) BME men are likely to be in insecure work. 12.4 per
   cent of BME women are in the same position, and among employees
   (excluding the self-employed) BME women are the most likely group to be
   subjected to insecure work.

   Those in insecure work by gender and ethnicity
   Ethnicity Gender
             Male          Female        Total
   White     11.1 per cent 10.3 per cent 10.7 per cent
   BME       15.7 per cent 12.4 per cent 14.1 per cent

   60 per cent of all BME workers desire more hours of work compared to 30
   per cent who do not and 10 per cent who are unsure. This contrasts
   sharply with White workers of whom 49 per cent want to work more hours,
   against 42 per cent who do not. [85]27

"One of the worst things I think that has come out of this last 10 years'
austerity Conservative government is zero-hour contracts. And I feel like,
while it's suitable for some people, I feel like people should opt into it
rather than be forced."

   Throughout this report we have seen examples of coercive and repressive
   workplace practices which serve to silence and disadvantage BME
   workers. Moreover, the statistics in this section show that the
   economic circumstances in which BME workers find themselves prevent
   many workers from challenging workplace racism, which in turn helps to
   conceal the true nature and extent of the problem.

   There is an unequal relationship between employees and employers, with
   individual workers remaining reluctant to have conversations with their
   employers for fear that they may face retribution - such as a reduction
   in hours. This would be especially worrying for those on a zero, or
   low, hours contract. State systems may reinforce these unequal power
   dynamics. Previous TUC research has shown that the perceived lack of
   impartiality of the tribunal system continues to deter many ethnic
   minority workers from attempting to seek justice. [86]28

   This research reinforces how racism is fundamental in determining who
   gets hired, trained, promoted, retained, demoted, and dismissed. The
   evidence also further demonstrates that it is wrong to dismiss reports
   of racism in the workplace. Indeed, racism shapes the class position,
   class experience and class relations between workers and employers. It
   plays an important role in explaining why BME people are more likely to
   be stuck in low-paid, non-permanent, and low-hour jobs.

Working in a pandemic

   The social and economic uncertainty that many BME workers have faced
   since the 2008 crisis has been exacerbated by the Covid-19 pandemic.
   This can be seen in the differential death rates. ONS figures from 2020
   highlighted that Black African men had the highest rate of death
   involving Covid-19, at 2.7 times higher than men of White ethnic
   background. Black Caribbean women had the highest rate at two times
   higher than women of White ethnic background. [87]29

   Bangladeshi, Pakistani, and Indian men also had a significantly higher
   risk of death involving Covid-19 (1.5 and 1.6 times, respectively) than
   White men once region, population density, socio-demographic and
   household characteristics were accounted for. [88]30

   As the disproportionate death rate of BME people has become clearer, it
   has highlighted serious issues in our health, employment, and housing
   systems. Around one in six BME workers felt they had been put more at
   risk of exposure to Covid-19 because of their ethnic background. Many
   reported being forced to do frontline work that White colleagues had
   refused to do. Others said they were denied access to PPE equipment,
   refused risk assessments, and were singled out to do high risk work.
   [89]31

   Despite promises made to `build back better' and recognise the
   contribution of key workers, employment conditions have not improved
   for many of those whose contribution was applauded throughout the
   pandemic.

Challenges for BME workers during the pandemic

   The pandemic presented significant challenges for BME workers, who were
   more likely to be working from workplaces, and more likely to be key
   workers. A high proportion of key worker jobs in retail, transport,
   hospitality, social care, and health are made up of people from BME
   communities.[90]32

   BME workers are twice as likely to be nurses, security guards or bus
   drivers, and almost 50% more likely to be waiters or waitresses. In
   addition, Black workers are 40% more likely than their White
   counterparts to work in health and social care and account for 20% of
   all child social workers  in the UK. Not only is low pay prevalent in
   these sectors, but pay growth is incredibly poor in the public
   sector.[91]33

   Whether it's nursing the sick in hospitals, looking after the elderly
   in care homes, keeping public transport going or producing and
   distributing food, BME workers had to go out to work in all kinds of
   environments, with a higher risk of exposure to coronavirus.The growth
   ofcasualisedforms of work designed to circumvent employment rights has
   also increased the risks BME workers face.

   While many employers worked constructively with unions throughout the
   pandemic, others took the opportunity to abuse workers' rights, for
   example by deploying fire and rehire or failing to pay staff properly.
   These experiences were reflected in our focus group interviews.

"My financial situation drastically changed as well so I was barely able to
afford to eat sometimes. I let them know. Basically, they owed me money, my
workplace, and they said that the only way they're able to pay me is when
they go into the workplace, because they need to process stuff there."

   Previous TUC research revealed a failure of employers to conduct
   effective risk assessments. BME workers repeatedly highlighted both a
   failure to conduct risk assessments and, when they were carried out, a
   lack of acknowledgement of the increased risks for BME people that they
   identified.[92]34 BME workers working in workplaces through the
   pandemic felt that even if their workplaces were safe in themselves,
   travelling still presented risks of contracting the virus.

"I did feel a bit worried because I have four kids of my own... What if I'm
going to go into school and what if I contract it and then I'm bringing all
this back home as well?"

The legacy of pandemic working from home

   Although disproportionately high numbers of Black workers worked from
   workplaces during the pandemic, significant numbers had to work from
   home for extended periods, often for the first time. Several studies
   since the pandemic have revealed that, following their pandemic
   experience, most employees prefer working partially or totally from
   home. However, few studies have looked at BME workers specifically. We
   wanted to hear from BME workers about their experiences of working from
   home.

   When asked where they've mostly worked since the pandemic began, 36 per
   cent of BME workers said they'd been working somewhere other than their
   home and 44 per cent said they'd been working from home. 7 per cent
   said other, 4 per cent were unsure and 9 per cent said the question
   wasn't applicable either due to furlough or unemployment.

   Of those who mostly worked from home:
     * 58 per cent said the experience was positive compared to how they
       worked before the pandemic
     * A third (33 per cent) said the experience had been both positive
       and negative
     * Only 5 per cent said it had been negative

   Almost half (46 per cent) said they had been subjected to the same
   level of surveillance or scrutiny from their employer as before the
   pandemic. 19 per cent said the level had increased, whereas 22 per cent
   said it had decreased.

   When asked about preferences for long-term working arrangements, the
   vast majority of home workers (89 per cent) said they wanted to
   continue working from home for at least some of their working time.
     * Almost four-in-ten home workers (38 per cent) want to work from
       home all the time
     * A further 28 per cent want to split their working time evenly
       between home and a workplace
     * 23 per cent want some sort of other combination between working
       from home and working at a workplace
     * Only 5 per cent want a full return to working in an external
       workplace

   Harassment and racism still happen when BME workers are working from
   home, with a quarter (24 per cent) reporting they experienced
   harassment while working from home.

   The most common forms were:
     * Racist jokes or banter (7 per cent)
     * Being excluded from work related meetings or conversations (6 per
       cent)
     * Being bullied or harassed (5 per cent) and being made to feel
       uncomfortable at work (5 per cent)

   As we move towards more workplaces becoming `hybrid', 'a risk that
   inequalities entrench between those workers who do have positive
   flexible working rights and those who do not, with Black workers less
   likely to be afforded the former, with those who work from home having
   less contact with managers and executives, effectively `falling out of
   sight and out of mind'.

   The findings above reveal a clear preference among BME workers for
   employers to be more flexible - while ensuring that changed working
   patterns do not exacerbate inequalities. Moreover, it is unsurprising
   that racism continues, whether people are working remotely or in
   workplaces. Although increasing flexibility for workers is a positive
   step, it must not replace the urgent need to address racism in the
   workplace. Employers must take meaningful action to ensure the safety
   of their workers, whether they are working at home or in workplaces.

Tackling racism

   In the aftermath of the Black Lives Matter protests in 2020, many
   employers launched diversity and inclusion initiatives. Around half of
   BME employees said their employer had some form of strategy to tackle
   racism in the workplace. However, 22 per cent said their employer had
   nothing in place, and around a quarter (24 per cent) said they didn't
   know if their employer had anything in place.

   21 per cent reported their employer hosted diversity and inclusion
   events and a similar percentage said that their employer had an
   anti-racism strategy and/or action plan. Concerningly, only 13 per cent
   said that their employer collected race equality data. When asked about
   BME staff development programmes, only 10 per cent said their employer
   had this in place, and only 9% said their employer had targets to
   tackle the underrepresentation of BME staff.

   When workplace race equality actions are in place, around 30-40 per
   cent of BME employees engage with them. Engagement is higher (40 per
   cent or more) with race equality pledges, the gathering of race
   equality data, anti-racism strategy and action plans, diversity and
   inclusion events, and BME staff development programmes.  For each
   action the majority of employees feel that it had a positive impact on
   their experience of the workplace as a BME worker.
   10

   It is clear from the research that significant numbers of employers are
   launching race equality actions and programmes. Whether or not these
   initiatives work remains to be seen. BME workers are rightly wary of
   tokenistic gestures, and more work needs to be done to ensure that
   impactful initiatives, with input from BME staff and subsequent robust
   evaluation, are introduced. Rather than employers taking part in
   box-ticking exercises that merely give the illusion that they are
   tackling racial inequality in the workplace, we need to see meaningful
   action.

   Itis important to note that discussing and challenging workplace racism
   often falls upon BME staff. This places a huge emotional burden on the
   shoulders of the people who are at the receiving end of this
   discrimination. Often BME workers are left having to manage and assuage
   the emotions of White people and the hostile responses they receive
   when trying to speak up and challenge workplace racism. Too many Black
   workers experience that their attempts to raise the question of racism
   with colleagues ends up with the behaviour of the complainant seen as
   the problem rather than the problem of workplace racism. Whatever our
   background, race or religion, workers are stronger together. Everybody
   benefits from anti-racism and fair treatment is everybody's
   responsibility.

What change is needed?

   We asked BME employees which policies and employer actions would
   improve things at work for BME people. There was no policy that was
   overwhelmingly popular or achieved even a majority of support. The most
   popular were:
     * Improving access to flexible working (32 per cent)
     * A new duty on employers to stop racism in the workplace (28 per
       cent)
     * Greater protections from unfair dismissal (27 per cent)
     * Removing names from job applications to stop bias from recruiting
       managers (27 per cent)
     * A pay rise for public sector workers (26 per cent)
     * Ethnicity pay gap reporting (26 per cent)

   11

   BME women were more likely than BME men to support many of these
   policies, such as improved access to flexible working, ethnicity pay
   gap reporting, an end to outsourcing, and a ban on zero-hours
   contracts. However, BME women were also slightly more likely to say
   that nothing needs to happen to improve things in the workplace for BME
   people.

   While no one policy gained a majority of support, it's clear that the
   majority of BME employees agree that something needs to be done. Only
   14 per cent of respondents said that nothing needs to happen to improve
   things for BME people in the workplace.

Conclusion and Recommendations

   The TUC Anti-Racism Taskforce commissioned this report to highlight the
   racism faced by BME workers in the labour market. There is an urgent
   need to effectively tackle racism and achieve a transformational change
   in workplace culture. This report gives a platform for the thousands of
   BME workers who have experienced racism at work to have their
   experiences revealed and recognised. It exposes the ongoing everyday
   reality of racism faced by many BME workers - and it demands a response
   from employers, government, and trade unions.

   Above everything, there must be a renewed urgency from everyone to
   tackle racism at work. Key to the change needed is one of mindset. Too
   often, racism is only seen as a problem when an individual incident is
   identified - such as when someone gets abused or treated differently
   because of their race. What is needed is instead a collective,
   pre-emptive response from all levels of government and employers that
   promotes equality and dignity for everyone, gives confidence to all
   staff that they need not stand for discrimination or bullying and makes
   dealing with racism at work everyone's responsibility.

Employers

   The TUC believes that this change cannot happen without transparency in
   the workplace. Employers need to collect the information to assess how
   institutional racism impacts their policy processes and practices. BME
   workers need to be confident to raise the problems they face within the
   workplace and that the experiences they relate will be heard and acted
   upon. Without this, the reality of racism in the workplace will
   continue to be hidden.

   Employers should:
     * Work with trade unions to establish a comprehensive ethnicity
       monitoring system covering ethnicity pay-gap reporting,
       recruitment, retention, promotion, pay and grading, access to
       training, performance management and discipline and grievance
       procedures.
     * Work with trade unions to establish targets and develop positive
       action measures to address racial inequalities within the
       workforce.
     * Ensure they have strong equality, diversity and dignity policy that
       explicitly includes zero tolerance of racism.
     * Make it clear that they will support all staff who raise concerns
       about racism and act to protect staff who are subject to racial
       abuse
     * Ensure there is a simple method for BME workers to report racism at
       work, and make sure that BME workers feel confident that complaints
       about racism will be taken seriously, acted on and dealt with
       satisfactorily.
     * Ensure that all staff know that workers who raise concerns about
       racism will not be victimised for doing so.

Government

   The TUC believes that the majority of measures considered by the
   current and past governments have concentrated on creating good
   practice in the public sector but have failed to recognise the need to
   encourage action in the private sector, which is the largest section of
   the labour market. Government policy on race relations and employment
   has mainly been aimed at creating good practice in the public sector on
   the premise that this will filter to the private sector.

   The TUC believes this is a false premise and that if race equality in
   employment is to be achieved, then discriminatory practice in the
   private sector, which makes up two-thirds of the labour market, must be
   tackled. The TUC believes that government needs to have a strong
   and coherent legal framework that directly addresses the race
   discrimination experienced by BME communities in the labour market and
   broader society.

   We call on government to adequately fund the EHRC as an independent
   monitoring body to address the alarming and deeply entrenched racism
   uncovered in this report. The EHRC and government must work together to
   ensure the implementation of recommendations outlined and follow this
   up with an annual mandatory report to Parliament on progress made.

   The Government should:

   Ensure that the workers at the sharp end of structural racism get a
   better deal. As outlined above, Black workers are significantly more
   likely to experience insecure and poor-quality work. Raising the floor
   of rights for everyone will have a disproportionate impact on these
   workers and make it harder for employers to operate a two-tier
   workforce. To achieve this government should:
     * Reform the rules on employment status to ensure that all workers
       benefit from the same employment rights, including statutory
       redundancy pay, protection from unfair dismissal, family-friendly
       rights, sick pay and rights to flexible working. To this end,
       employment status law should be modernised, putting an end to the
       current two-tier workforce.
     * Ban the regular use of zero-hours contracts, and ensure all workers
       receive adequate notice of shifts, and compensation when shifts are
       cancelled at short notice.
     * We need to give workers stronger rights to speak with one voice and
       bargain with their employer and give unions access to workplaces to
       tell workers about the benefits of union membership, following the
       New Zealand model.
     * And starting in sectors that are characterised by low pay and poor
       conditions, we need to create new bodies for workers and employers
       to come together to set minimum standards and Fair Pay Agreements
       across the sector, starting with social care.

    Ensure that employers have a duty to embed race equality practices in
   their workplaces. Employers are responsible for taking corrective and
   preventative action. They must ensure that they take measurable steps
   to prevent situations in which their employees are at risk of
   encountering racism. To achieve this, government should:
     * Change the law to make employers responsible for protecting their
       workers against racism by third parties, such as clients,
       contractors, and customers.
     * Introduce race equality requirements into public sector contracts
       for the supply of goods and services, to incentivise companies to
       improve their race equality policies and practices, minimise the
       use of zero-hours, temporary and agency contracts, and promote
       permanent employment. Companies that do not meet the requirements
       should not be awarded a public contract.
     * Legislate to make private sector companies responsible for
       promoting equal treatment throughout their activities, just as
       public sector organisations already are.
     * Remove names from job applications to stop bias from recruiting
       managers.

   Ensure that there are swift and effective penalties when workers
   experience racism.  Everyone deserves to be treated with respect and
   dignity at work. All forms of alleged harassment and bullying must be
   dealt with seriously and swiftly. To achieve this, government should:
     * Re-introduce third-party harassment provisions (section 40 of the
       Equality Act 2010) to enable BME workers to seek remedy where they
       have been subject to third-party harassment.
     * Reinstate the power for employment tribunals to make broader
       recommendations.
     * Reinstate the statutory discrimination questionnaires to enable BME
       workers to seek information from their employer about potential
       discriminatory actions.
     * Enact Section 14 of the Equality Act 2010 to allow applications of
       dual discrimination to be heard by employment tribunals.

Enforcement

   The TUC believes that an independent Equality and Human Rights
   Commission (EHRC) with strong promotion and enforcement powers is
   fundamental to challenging racialdiscrimination in the labour market
   and the wider community.

   We remain concerned that the relationship between the EHRC and its
   sponsoring departments has seriously undermined the EHRC's role as an
   independent body that can challenge and advise the government on race
   equality matters. The Equality Act 2006, Part 4, s.42 (3) states that
   `the Minister shall have regard to the desirability of ensuring that
   the Commission is under as few constraints as reasonably possible in
   determining its activities, its timetables, and its priorities'. The
   TUC believes that the EHRC is subject to inappropriate political
   pressure and that the considerable reductions in the EHRC's budget have
   undermined its ability to carry out its role.

   To ensure effective independent enforcement:
     * The government should transfer responsibility for the EHRC from the
       Secretary of State to Parliament, through the Justice and Human
       Rights Commission or Women and Equalities Committee to ensure its
       independence from government.
     * Ensure the Equalities and Human Rights Commission has enough
       funding to promote workplace anti-racist policies and practices and
       take more legal cases to make sure the law reflects the nature of
       contemporary racism.

Trade unions

   Unions have an important role to play in ensuring that BME workers have
   a strong and effective voice at work, and it is crucial that trade
   unions engage with employers to tackle policies and practices that
   perpetuate institutional racism in the workplace. To achieve this,
   trade unions need to:
     * Improve training for trade union reps to enable them to identify
       and effectively tackle racism in the workplace.
     * Work with employers to establish a comprehensive ethnic monitoring
       system covering ethnicity pay-gap reporting, recruitment,
       retention, promotion, pay and grading, access to training,
       performance management and discipline and grievance procedures.
     * Work with employers to develop action plans that address racial
       disparities in their workplaces.
     * Work to improve the confidence of BME members in our ability to
       represent them on all matters, including tackling racism at work.

State Farm accused of covert racialdiscrimination in claims processing

   A Black Illinois homeowner claims State Farm practices covert racial
   discrimination in how it processes claims.

   "State Farm does not treat its Black and white homeowners insurance
   policyholders equally," [225]states a federal lawsuit filed by
   Jacqueline Huskey of Matteson in south suburban Chicago.

   The filing claims the Bloomington-based company uses computer
   algorithms that have the effect of disproportionately delaying claims
   of African American homeowners. White homeowners were almost a third
   more likely than Black homeowners to have their claim processed
   expeditiously -- in less than a month. It alleges the company is 39%
   more likely to ask for additional information from Black homeowners.

   "We take this filing seriously. This suit does not reflect the values
   we hold at State Farm," said a State Farm statement.

   Huskey said State Farm repeatedly delayed assessing hail damage to her
   house, forced her to provide additional information, and declined to
   pay part of the claim for external damage to the home. The lawsuit
   alleges Huskey is far from alone.

   Huskey's lawyers said they based their case for systemic racial
   discrimination on a study of more than 800 State Farm policyholders in
   the Midwestern states of Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, Missouri, Ohio,
   and Wisconsin. The Center on Race, Inequality, and the Law at New York
   University School of Law did the survey and analysis.

   "Claims made by Black homeowners are disproportionately subjected to
   greater suspicion than claims made by their white counterparts: State
   Farm is more likely to request additional claims documentation from
   Black claimants and Black claimants must have more interactions with
   State Farm employees to resolve their claims," according to the
   lawsuit.

   The center declined a WGLT request for an interview, citing the
   litigation. The filing in the northern district of Illinois asks for
   class action status.

   "Inequitable practices such as these make it more difficult for Black
   homeowners to build wealth through home ownership at the same rate as
   white homeowners," alleges the suit.

   Attorneys claimed the study shows the difference in the rates the
   company asks Black and white homeowners to provide extra information
   about is less than 1% likely to be random chance. Longer claims
   processing time for Black customers is less than 5% likely to be by
   chance, according to the study. The lawsuit alleges State Farm's data
   mining of information such as physical appearance, genetics,
   geo-location, social media presence, and browser search history,
   functions as a proxy for race. The case also claims historical housing
   and claims data used by State Farm are "infected with racial bias."

   "State Farm's claims processing methods have a demonstrable and
   widespread discriminatory impact on Black homeowners making insurance
   claims, in violation of the FHA," asserts the lawsuit.

   The practices, the suit contends, contribute to societal difficulties
   Black people have in creating intergenerational wealth, financial
   security, and preservation of home values. The case suggested State
   Farm is far from alone in use of computer machine learning programs
   that fail to be even-handed.

   "In recent years, algorithmic decision-making has produced biased,
   discriminatory, and otherwise problematic outcomes in some of the most
   important areas of the American economy. ... These harms are often felt
   most acutely by historically disadvantaged populations, especially
   Black Americans and other communities of color," according to a comment
   by Federal Trade Commissioner Kelly Slaughter that is referenced in the
   court filing.

   Other figures cited in the lawsuit laid out a landscape tilted against
   Black families.

   "In 2020, 73.7% of white families owned homes, compared to only 44% of
   Black families," found economists at Freddie Mac in 2020, that
   continued, "12.5% of homes in majority Black areas are appraised below
   the price agreed upon by the buyer and seller, compared to just 7.4% of
   homes in majority-white areas." f.

   Researchers also have determined that relative to their home value,
   Black homeowners pay higher mortgage rates, spend more on mortgage
   insurance, face a higher share of maintenance costs, and pay more in
   property taxes than white homeowners, resulting in a higher home
   ownership cost burden.

   "State Farm is committed to a diverse and inclusive environment, where
   all customers and associates are treated with fairness, respect, and
   dignity. We are dedicated to paying what we owe, promptly and
   courteously," said the company.

   Film producer Randall Emmett has settled a lawsuit brought by a former
   assistant who had accused him of racialdiscrimination and creating a
   hostile workplace that included the use of the N-word.

   Martin G'Blae, 29, who worked at the production company Emmett/Furla
   Oasis for much of 2020, [130]brought a lawsuit in Los Angeles Superior
   Court earlier this month. The complaint contained 24 claims of alleged
   legal violations, including that Emmett had allegedly asked G'Blae to
   transport cocaine and file an insurance claim for a missing Rolls
   Royce, which G'Blae had maintained wasn't actually stolen.

   G'Blae had served as a production assistant on Emmett's action movie
   "Midnight in the Switchgrass" with Bruce Willis.

   G'Blae, who is Black, had alleged that race discrimination was a factor
   in his termination.

assistant

   The lawsuit against Emmett alleges that the producer called rapper 50
   Cent the N-word during an office outburst in 2020.

   "The parties have discussed their claims and potential claims against
   each other and as a result of these discussion, Mr. G'Blae's complaint
   is being dismissed with prejudice," G'Blae's lawyer Young K. Park said
   Wednesday in a brief statement. Park declined to comment beyond that.

   Financial terms were not disclosed.

   "Mr. G'Blae has decided to dismiss his complaint and Mr. Emmett has
   agreed to not pursue damages for what he strenuously maintains were
   false allegations made against him," Suann MacIsaac, Emmett's attorney
   at the Kinsella Weitzman law firm, said in a statement. "The matter is
   now closed."

   G'Blae's attorneys and those representing Emmett and his business
   partner, George Furla, worked to quickly resolve the complaint, which
   asserted that Emmett made racist comments about Black performers,
   including rappers 50 Cent, Cardi B and Quavo. Both sides appeared
   motivated to avoid drawn-out litigation or a bruising trial.

   Quavo, an Atlanta rapper, co-stars in an Emmett-directed Robert De Niro
   movie, "Savage Salvation," that is scheduled for release next month.

   Several of G'Blae's complaints were described in a Los Angeles Times
   [134]investigation last summer into Emmett's crumbling empire. The
   Times detailed allegations of mistreatment of women, assistants and
   investors who poured millions of dollars into Emmett's film projects.
   Several financiers are now suing Emmett and Furla for civil fraud,
   which both men deny.

[138]The man who played Hollywood: Inside Randall Emmett's crumbling empire

   The ex-fiance of reality star Lala Kent faces the collapse of his
   company amid a trail of lawsuits, civil fraud charges and allegations
   of abusive behavior.

   The filing comes amid a rising tide of [139]discontent among Hollywood
   assistants, who have spoken out about low wages and harsh treatment by
   Hollywood executives.

   Emmett has been a fixture in Hollywood for two decades, [140]producing
   more than 120 movies, including low-budget action films [141]starring
   Bruce Willis, Sylvester Stallone and Mel Gibson. Emmett also has
   co-produced critically acclaimed movies, including Peter Berg's "Lone
   Survivor" and two Martin Scorsese films, "Silence" and the
   Oscar-nominated "The Irishman" for Netflix.

   G'Blae, who was paid $1,500 every two weeks, said in the complaint that
   he was on call 12 hours a day and on weekends, resulting in pay that
   amounted to less than California's minimum wage. In addition, G'Blae
   said he was often asked to cover Emmett's personal expenses, including
   meals and stays, without full reimbursement.

Family of 10-year-old accused of groping school employee fights allegations,
racialdiscrimination
     __________________________________________________________________

   [22]Danielle Johnson   | The Daytona Beach News-Journal

   DAYTONA BEACH, Fla. -- A family is demanding action from Volusia County
   Schools after a district mental health counselor pressed charges
   against a [23]10-year-old student whom [24]she accused of groping her.

   The incident has made national headlines -- and even provided material
   to [25]Saturday Night Live -- but the family says the boy did not grab
   the employee's breast during a hug like she reported to the Holly Hill
   Police Department. They have hired an attorney to defend the boy, who
   served a 10-day suspension from school and is still facing simple
   battery charges.

   In addition to clearing the boy's record, the family is demanding the
   school district fire the employee and discipline others involved.

   "We will not stand by this and allow him to be accused of something
   that he did not do," Ed Hollins, the boy's grandfather, said at a
   virtual press conference Monday morning. "I would not stand for my
   grandchild or any child to be treated this way by a professional. This
   is a new way of lynching."

   student after she says she was groped

   The family, along with attorney Rawsi Williams and [27]West Volusia
   NAACP President Sean King, said the boy is among the latest of many
   Black students who have been disproportionately and more severely
   punished by the Volusia County school system.

   "Over the last two years of being president, this is a weekly call that
   I'm getting with situations of this nature, especially with the Volusia
   County school system, where our Black and brown kids are put on the
   wrong end of every situation, and no matter how you confront the issue,
   it continues to happen," King said, calling the incident a "travesty."

   The News-Journal, a part of the USA TODAY Network, does not name or
   publish photos of juveniles accused of crimes. It is also not naming
   the district employee, who has opted into [28]Marsy's Law to protect
   her privacy.

Employee accused boy of groping her

   The district mental health counselor reported the alleged incident Oct.
   24.

   A suspension letter sent to the boy's guardians stated the counselor
   was in the student's classroom discussing another student when the
   class returned from lunch and the child "approached (the counselor) to
   hug her."

   "(The counselor) turned sideways to give a side hug," the report
   stated. "(The student) put his left arm around her shoulder and then
   with his right hand he reached and grabbed her left breast in which she
   had to grab his wrist and remove his hand."

   The explanation states that the student "proceeded to smirk and walk
   away" and later "began yelling and kicking things and stormed off" when
   his primary teacher called him to ask about the incident.

   The Holly Hill Police Department report, which the employee
   subsequently filed, stated that the incident, which was reported as a
   simple battery, happened around 11:30 a.m. to noon.

   That report states that the counselor saw the student running toward
   her and turned her body. The student hugged her and then "cupped her
   left breast in a disrespectful way," and she had to "forcibly remove
   his hand," she told police.

   The report also notes that the primary teacher in the classroom did not
   witness the incident, but tried to talk to the student about it
   afterward.

   unpunished at exclusive California private school

Black students disproportionately disciplined, attorney says

   The family disputes the counselor's version of the incident and notes
   there were no witnesses. They also object to the school district's
   handling of the "wrongful suspension."

   "That really hit me really hard that a mental health specialist could
   accuse my grandson of (that), and then the wording that she used, it
   was so graphic, like he's some kind of sex maniac or something. It's
   like, this really hurts," the boy's grandmother, Lakesha Hollins, said
   after wiping away tears with a tissue.

   The family's pastor, Cynthia Williams, said the boy is loving, kind,
   honest and well-mannered.

   The child's father, whom The News-Journal is not naming to protect the
   boy's identity, said he was at a loss for words when the boy asked if
   people would look at him as a "monster" rather than as himself when he
   returns to school.

   The family is awaiting a meeting to allow the boy to return to school
   and has requested he be put in a different classroom and have no
   contact with the counselor. The district considered whether to expel
   the 10-year-old but did not find enough evidence to do so.

   "Time and time again, we have seen Volusia County Schools violate the
   rights of their Black students," Williams, the family's Miami-based
   attorney, said.

   Williams has previously defended [30]two Black students who accused
   district employees of putting them in chokeholds in two separate
   incidents.

   She said calls that she gets from minority families are often related
   to suspension or extreme discipline, such as choking or "unwarranted
   and excessive physical contact." Non-minority families more often reach
   out to her about bullying and less severe incidents.

Family wants record cleared, charges dropped and apology

   In this situation, Williams is asking the school district to reverse
   the boy's suspension; expunge the incident from his record; apologize
   to the family; terminate the mental health counselor; and discipline
   the school's principal and the other teacher in the room, whom they say
   yelled at the boy and wrongfully accused him, even though she did not
   witness it.

   Williams says they have already contacted the Florida Department of
   Education to file complaints against the licenses and certifications of
   the counselor, teacher and principal. They also plan to file complaints
   against Volusia County Schools with the U.S. Department of Education
   for the "well-known and pervasive pattern" of racialdiscrimination
   within the district.

   She said the district failed to follow its own policy for investigation
   and discipline, as it did not comply with the family's request to meet
   with the school and did not notify the family of a meeting to uphold
   the suspension.

   Massive outcry: [31]Family of a Black Utah fifth grader who died by
   suicide to sue for school's response to bullying

   Williams also noted the suspension notice was not signed by the school
   and left several boxes blank regarding whether the child had been given
   a chance to present his version or deny the charges, as well as whether
   the parent was called.

   VCS Director of Communications Angel Gomez previously shared via email
   that a District Student Placement Committee determines whether to
   recommend students for expulsion. He said the committee meets privately
   and no one else is allowed at the meetings, but parents and guardians
   could appeal a decision afterward.

   "The student has been disciplined to the extent of the student code of
   conduct. Under Florida law, teachers remain private citizens and school
   districts cannot encourage nor prohibit the exercise of criminal
   charges or prosecutions by employees," Gomez wrote on Monday. "Volusia
   County Schools is not able to make any comments regarding any
   disciplinary action on a student or any action taken by a staff member
   involving student discipline."

   Even if he did accidentally touch the counselor, Williams says the
   discipline was not "restorative and logical," as a [32]document on the
   district's discipline procedures states. That phrasing, which appears
   in a 2020 introduction to the student conduct code, says discipline
   should make "sense to everyone involved," and that "teaching students
   to really think about how their behavior affects others" is key.

   "Reasonable adults would have said, `This was an accident,' and moved
   on," she said.

   On a second stage, Williams is prepared to fight the pending charge
   filed with the Holly Hill Police Department if it moves forward.

   She said the police department has instructed that the charge would be
   dropped if the student attended a program for the alleged deviancy,
   which they are opposing on the grounds that the boy did nothing wrong.

   A third course may be to demand damages from the school district
   through a federal lawsuit for violating the boy's rights, which could
   unfold further down the road.

Psychology undergraduate aims to better understand the role of discrimination
in sleep

Crystal Li conducts research on minority populations and the transition to
college
     __________________________________________________________________

   December 19, 2022

   Crystal Li, an Arizona State University undergraduate psychology major
   with a minor in Spanish, hopes to make a difference in diverse
   communities through graduate research.

   When she was in high school, she volunteered in an underserved
   community in the San Francisco Bay Area that had just been hit with a
   U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement raid for undocumented
   immigrants. Her internship gave her firsthand experience with the
   impact that research and interventions can have on the youth in the
   community. She conducted research with the students, and from that
   point on, she knew that she wanted to pursue psychology research.

   "The first lab that I joined was the [32]Adolescent Stress and Emotion
   Lab with Professor [33]Leah Doane. I've been in that lab for almost two
   years now, and the other lab that I'm a part of is the [34]Arizona Twin
   Project with professors [35]Mary Davis and [36]Kathryn
   Lemery-Chalfant," Li said. "Coming into college, I really didn't know
   what specifically my research interests were, but all I knew was that I
   really wanted to prioritize working in a lab that worked with diverse
   populations."

   The Adolescent Stress and Emotion Lab conducts research on child and
   adolescent well-being using physiological, psychological and contextual
   factors with a particular focus on stress.

   "We focus on understanding daily experiences, physiology and sleep in
   the prediction of health and academic trajectories, as well as how
   transactions between culture and neurobiological systems may influence
   these pathways across development," Doane said.

   While conducting research in the lab, Li was mentored by graduate
   student Jeri Sasser, a graduate mentor in the ASU [37]ENERGIZE project,
   which guides underrepresented students in psychology and neuroscience
   to streamline the process of conducting research to prepare for
   graduate school. This mentorship encouraged Li to also give back as an
   undergraduate mentor in the program.

   "I'm currently an ENERGIZE peer mentor. This means that I mentor
   students about labs and connect them to resources, as well as check in
   and see how everything's going. I think that's really a nice little
   thing to do because Jeri was that person for me when I joined the
   Adolescent Stress and Emotion Lab. Mentorship is so important to
   inspire students to continue pursuing research and to believe that they
   have a place in research," Li said.

   Li is currently applying to doctoral programs for developmental
   psychology. Her future research interests are in studying culture,
   sleep and stress, and academics and their role in development among
   ethnic, racial and minority youth.

   This fall, Li also defended her honors thesis as part of the psychology
   honors seminar on the relationship between ethnic racialdiscrimination
   and both objective and subjective measures of sleep among Latino
   students in their transition to college.

   "I presented to my classmates as well as my thesis committee, which was
   Dr. Doane, Dr. Jinni Su, Dr. Thao Ha and Jeri Sasser," Li said. "It was
   such a wonderful experience, but I'm so glad it is over now! I spent
   over a year and a half on the project, and to see it through to
   completion was extremely validating."

   Li's advice to other students who are scared of pursuing research? Just
   go for it.

   "I was very scared to join a lab because I had no idea what to expect
   and I didn't know if I was well-suited for that kind of environment.
   Research can be really daunting for students - that's why I really
   appreciate what ENERGIZE is doing, and I wish I'd known about it when I
   was initially applying to labs," Li said.

   "Something that I'm really interested in looking at is continuing my
   investigation of my honors thesis on discrimination in sleep and
   further exploring protective factors that can help protect you from
   harmful effects of discrimination," Li said. "Transitioning into higher
   education is difficult for many people, and when you add in any kind of
   race-based stressor, that can be a huge barrier."

   The Walter Cronkite School of Journalism and Mass Communication fall
   2022 convocation ceremony celebrated the accomplishments of almost 340
   graduates while also serving as a homecoming for one of its most
   supportive and successful alumni.

   Christine Devine, an Arizona State University trustee and Cronkite
   Alumni Hall of Fame inductee, delivered the keynote address at the
   ceremony held on Wednesday, Dec. 14, at Desert Financial Arena in
   Tempe. Students wearing maroon and gold caps and gowns, smiling widley

   Devine is an award-winning television news anchor with Fox 11 Los
   Angeles, where she has worked for more than 30 years, and an active
   Cronkite School alumna who generously supports the school and ASU. In
   2007, she endowed the Christine Devine Scholarship, which provides
   scholarship support each year to students in the Cronkite School.

   In her convocation speech, Devine reflected on her journey that started
   as a Cronkite student in the 1980s and took her through a couple of
   small and medium media markets before landing in Los Angeles in 1990.

   Devine, who grew up in Tolleson, Arizona, the Phoenix area's West
   Valley, began her broadcasting career working as a reporter in San
   Angelo, Texas. She credited former ASU journalism professor Ben Silver
   with helping her find the job after he posted her resume on a board at
   a news directors conference.

   "I'd go to McDonald's and I would order a cheeseburger and water. I had
   no money," she said. "But that job would lead me to say we don't do
   this for the money. We do it for the passion of wanting to be a part of
   the ever-changing world. To not sit on the sidelines, but to be in the
   game."

   Devine emphasized that life was about to change for the graduates as
   they were about to enter their careers, but she encouraged them to
   learn from their mistakes and celebrate their successes.

   "So there will be fewer football games, Friday night parties, the
   camaraderie you all have here. It is all the real world, to which I say
   -- give life a shot," she said.

   She told the graduates to "find your passion, your place to contribute,
   your place to shine."

   Devine also encouraged students to stay in touch with ASU and the
   Cronkite School by joining the alumni association, visiting campus and
   connecting with fellow Sun Devils if they move to a new city.

   Her decision to give back to ASU was influenced by a mentor she met
   when she moved to Los Angeles, who she credits with helping her develop
   as a young woman and professional at the time.

   "You don't need to touch the masses, but please work to touch just one
   life, just one person," she said.

   In total, 337 students received degrees, including 80 with a Bachelor
   of Arts in mass communication and media studies, 53 with a Bachelor of
   Arts in journalism and mass communication, 61 with a Bachelor of
   Science in digital audiences, 30 Bachelor of Arts in sports journalism
   and one with a Bachelor of Arts in digital media literacy.

   The Cronkite School also awarded 111 master's degrees. That includes 58
   with a Master of Science in digital audience strategy, 16 with a Master
   of Mass Communication, 21 with a Master of Arts in sports journalism,
   15 with a Master of Arts in investigative journalism and one with a
   Master of Science in business journalism. One student received a PhD in
   Journalism and Mass Communication.

   Student speaker Raven Payne referred to her fellow classmates as
   resilient for having endured a global pandemic during their time at the
   Cronkite School, which forced them to adjust the way they learned,
   worked on projects and reported their stories.

   Payne implored her classmates to follow their own paths, create their
   opportunities and not to settle.

   "Times are changing, and if they don't change fast enough, we will
   change them ourselves," she said. "We have the pen, paper and will to
   be the authors of our own stories."

                               I. Introduction

   After the Civil War, much of the South lay in ruins. "It passes my
   comprehension to tell what became of our railroads," one South
   Carolinian told a northern reporter. "We had passably good roads, on
   which we could reach almost any part of the State, and the next week
   they were all gone--not simply broken up, but gone. Some of the
   material was burned, I know, but miles and miles of iron have actually
   disappeared, gone out of existence."^[35]1 He might as well have been
   talking about the entire antebellum way of life. The future of the
   South was uncertain. How would these states be brought back into the
   Union? Would they be conquered territories or equal states? How would
   they rebuild their governments, economies, and social systems? What
   rights did freedom confer on formerly enslaved people?

   The answers to many of Reconstruction's questions hinged on the
   concepts of citizenship and equality. The era witnessed perhaps the
   most open and widespread discussions of citizenship since the nation's
   founding. It was a moment of revolutionary possibility and violent
   backlash. African Americans and Radical Republicans pushed the nation
   to finally realize the Declaration of Independence's promises that "all
   men are created equal" and have "certain unalienable rights." White
   Democrats granted African Americans legal freedom but little more. When
   Black Americans and their radical allies succeeded in securing
   citizenship for freedpeople, a new fight commenced to determine the
   legal, political, and social implications of American citizenship.
   Resistance continued, and Reconstruction eventually collapsed. In the
   South, limits on human freedom endured and would stand for nearly a
   century more.


                       II. Politics of Reconstruction

   [36]This political cartoon Johnson stitching together the globe while
   Lincoln supports it with a rail. The caption reads "The Rail Splitter
   at work repairing the Union." Johnson says, "Take it quietly Uncle Abe
   and I will draw it closer than ever!" Lincoln says, "A few more
   stitches Andy and the good old Union will be mended!"

   With the war coming to an end, the question of how to reunite the
   former Confederate states with the Union was a divisive one. Lincoln's
   Presidential Reconstruction plans were seen by many, including Radical
   Republicans in Congress, to be too tolerant towards what they
   considered to be traitors. This political cartoon reflects this
   viewpoint, showing Lincoln and Johnson happily stitching the Union back
   together with little anger towards the South. Joseph E. Baker, The
   `Rail Splitter' at Work Repairing the Union, 1865. [37]Library of
   Congress.

   Reconstruction--the effort to restore southern states to the Union and
   to redefine African Americans' place in American society--began before
   the Civil War ended. President Abraham Lincoln began planning for the
   reunification of the United States in the fall of 1863.^[38]2 With a
   sense that Union victory was imminent and that he could turn the tide
   of the war by stoking Unionist support in the Confederate states,
   Lincoln issued a proclamation allowing southerners to take an oath of
   allegiance. When just 10 percent of a state's voting population had
   taken such an oath, loyal Unionists could then establish
   governments.^[39]3 These so-called Lincoln governments sprang up in
   pockets where Union support existed like Louisiana, Tennessee, and
   Arkansas. Unsurprisingly, these were also the places that were exempted
   from the liberating effects of the Emancipation Proclamation.

   Initially proposed as a war aim, Lincoln's Emancipation Proclamation
   committed the United States to the abolition of slavery. However, the
   proclamation freed only enslaved people in areas of rebellion and left
   more than seven hundred thousand in bondage in Delaware, Kentucky,
   Maryland, and Missouri as well as in Union-occupied areas of Louisiana,
   Tennessee, and Virginia.

   To cement the abolition of slavery, Congress passed the Thirteenth
   Amendment on January 31, 1865. The amendment legally abolished slavery
   "except as a punishment for crime whereof the party shall have been
   duly convicted." Section Two of the amendment granted Congress the
   "power to enforce this article by appropriate legislation." State
   ratification followed, and by the end of the year the requisite three
   fourths of the states had approved the amendment, and four million
   people were forever free from the slavery that had existed in North
   America for 250 years.^[40]4

   Lincoln's policy was lenient, conservative, and short-lived.
   Reconstruction changed when John Wilkes Booth shot Lincoln on April 14,
   1865, during a performance of Our American Cousin at Ford's Theater.
   Treated rapidly and with all possible care, Lincoln nevertheless
   succumbed to his wounds the following morning, leaving a somber pall
   over the North and especially among African Americans.

   The assassination of Abraham Lincoln propelled Vice President Andrew
   Johnson into the executive office in April 1865. Johnson, a
   states'-rights, strict-constructionist, and unapologetic racist from
   Tennessee, offered southern states a quick restoration into the Union.
   His Reconstruction plan required provisional southern governments to
   void their ordinances of secession, repudiate their Confederate debts,
   and ratify the Thirteenth Amendment. On all other matters, the
   conventions could do what they wanted with no federal interference. He
   pardoned all southerners engaged in the rebellion with the exception of
   wealthy planters who possessed more than $20,000 in property.^[41]5 The
   southern aristocracy would have to appeal to Johnson for individual
   pardons. In the meantime, Johnson hoped that a new class of southerners
   would replace the extremely wealthy in leadership positions
   .

   Many southern governments enacted legislation that reestablished
   antebellum power relationships. South Carolina and Mississippi passed
   laws known as Black Codes to regulate Black behavior and impose social
   and economic control. Other states soon followed. These laws granted
   some rights to African Americans, like the right to own property, to
   marry, or to make contracts. But they also denied fundamental rights.
   White lawmakers forbade Black men from serving on juries or in state
   militias, refused to recognize Black testimony against white people,
   apprenticed orphaned children to their former enslaver, and established
   severe vagrancy laws. Mississippi's vagrant law required all freedmen
   to carry papers proving they had means of employment.^[42]6 If they had
   no proof, they could be arrested and fined. If they could not pay the
   fine, the sheriff had the right to hire out his prisoner to anyone who
   was willing to pay the tax. Similar ambiguous vagrancy laws throughout
   the South reasserted control over Black labor in what one scholar has
   called "slavery by another name."^[43]7 Black Codes effectively
   criminalized Black people's leisure, limited their mobility, and locked
   many into exploitative farming contracts. Attempts to restore the
   antebellum economic order largely succeeded.

   These laws and outrageous mob violence against Black southerners led
   Republicans to call for a more dramatic Reconstruction. So when Johnson
   announced that the southern states had been restored, congressional
   Republicans refused to seat delegates from the newly reconstructed
   states.

   Republicans in Congress responded with a spate of legislation aimed at
   protecting freedmen and restructuring political relations in the South.
   Many Republicans were keen to grant voting rights for freedmen in order
   to build a new powerful voting bloc. Some Republicans, like U.S.
   congressman Thaddeus Stevens, believed in racial equality, but the
   majority were motivated primarily by the interest of their political
   party. The only way to protect Republican interests in the South was to
   give the vote to the hundreds of thousands of Black men. Republicans in
   Congress responded to the codes with the Civil Rights Act of 1866, the
   first federal attempt to constitutionally define all American-born
   residents (except Native peoples) as citizens. The law also prohibited
   any curtailment of citizens' "fundamental rights."^[44]8

   the map of the nation. Dozens of floating heads depicting major
   political luminaries float above between two angels.

   While no one could agree on what the best plan for reconstructing the
   nation would be, Americans understood the moment as critical and
   perhaps revolutionary. In this magnificent visual metaphor for the
   reconciliation of the North and South, John Lawrence postulates what
   might result from reunion. Reconstruction, the print seems to argue,
   will form a more perfect Union that upholds the ideals of the American
   Revolution, most importantly (as seen on a streaming banner near the
   top) that "All men are born free and equal." John Giles Lawrence,
   Reconstruction, 1867. [46]Library of Congress.

   The Fourteenth Amendment developed concurrently with the Civil Rights
   Act to ensure its constitutionality. The House of Representatives
   approved the Fourteenth Amendment on June 13, 1866. Section One granted
   citizenship and repealed the Taney Court's infamous Dred Scott (1857)
   decision. Moreover, it ensured that state laws could not deny due
   process or discriminate against particular groups of people. The
   Fourteenth Amendment signaled the federal government's willingness to
   enforce the Bill of Rights over the authority of the states.

   Because he did not believe African Americans deserved equal rights,
   President Johnson opposed the passage of the Fourteenth Amendment and
   vetoed the Civil Rights Act. But after winning a two-thirds majority in
   the 1866 midterm elections, Republicans overrode the veto, and in 1867,
   they passed the first Reconstruction Act, dissolving state governments
   and dividing the South into five military districts. Under these new
   terms, states would have to ratify the Fourteenth Amendment, write new
   constitutions enfranchising African Americans, and abolish repressive
   "Black Codes" before rejoining the union. In the face of President
   Johnson's repeated obstructionism, the House of Representatives issued
   articles of impeachment against the president. Although Johnson
   narrowly escaped conviction in the Senate, Congress won the power to
   direct a new phase of Reconstruction. Six weeks later, on July 9, 1868,
   the states ratified the Fourteenth Amendment, guaranteeing birthright
   citizenship and "equal protection of the laws.

   In the 1868 presidential election, former Union General Ulysses S.
   Grant ran on a platform that proclaimed, "Let Us Have Peace," in which
   he promised to protect the new status quo. On the other hand, the
   Democratic candidate, Horatio Seymour, promised to repeal
   Reconstruction. Black southern voters helped Grant win most of the
   former Confederacy. Scalawags and Carpetbaggers also buttressed
   Republicans in the South. Scalawag was the derisive term used to
   describe white Republicans in the South and carpetbaggers was the term
   for northerners who traveled to the South during Reconstruction. But
   Black voters formed the backbone of the Republican coalition in the
   South.

   Reconstruction brought the first moment of mass democratic
   participation for African Americans. In 1860, only five states in the
   North allowed African Americans to vote on equal terms with whites. Yet
   after 1867, when Congress ordered southern states to eliminate racial
   discrimination in voting, African Americans began to win elections
   across the South. In a short time, the South was transformed from an
   all-white, pro-slavery, Democratic stronghold to a collection of
   Republican-led states with African Americans in positions of power for
   the first time in American history.^[49]9

   Through the provisions of the congressional Reconstruction Acts, Black
   men voted in large numbers and also served as delegates to the state
   constitutional conventions in 1868. Black delegates actively
   participated in revising state constitutions. One of the most
   significant accomplishments of these conventions was the establishment
   of a public school system. While public schools were virtually
   nonexistent in the antebellum period, by the end of Reconstruction,
   every southern state had established a public school system.^[50]10
   Republican officials opened state institutions like mental asylums,
   hospitals, orphanages, and prisons to white and Black residents, though
   often on a segregated basis. They actively sought industrial
   development, northern investment, and internal improvements.

   African Americans served at every level of government during
   Reconstruction. At the federal level, Hiram Revels and Blanche K. Bruce
   were chosen as U.S. senators from Mississippi. Fourteen men served in
   the House of Representatives. At least 270 other African American men
   served in patronage positions as postmasters, customs officials,
   assessors, and ambassadors. At the state level, more than 1,000 African
   American men held offices in the South. P. B. S. Pinchback served as
   Louisiana's governor for thirty-four days after the previous governor
   was suspended during impeachment proceedings and was the only African
   American state governor until Virginia elected L. Douglas Wilder in
   1989. Almost 800 African American men served as state legislators
   around the South, with African Americans at one time making up a
   majority in the South Carolina House of Representatives.^[51]11
   [52]The era of Reconstruction witnessed a few moments of true progress.
   One of those was the election of African Americans to local, state, and
   national offices, including both houses of Congress. Pictured here are

   African American officeholders came from diverse backgrounds. Many had
   been born free or had gained their freedom before the Civil War. Many
   free African Americans, particularly those in South Carolina, Virginia,
   and Louisiana, were wealthy and well educated, two facts that
   distinguished them from much of the white population both before and
   after the Civil War. Some, like Antoine Dubuclet of Louisiana and
   William Breedlove from Virginia, owned enslaved laborers before the
   Civil War. Others had helped enslaved people escape or taught them to
   read, like Georgia's James D. Porter.

   Most African American officeholders, however, gained their freedom
   during the war. Among them were skilled craftsmen like Emanuel Fortune,
   a shoemaker from Florida; ministers such as James D. Lynch from
   Mississippi; and teachers like William V. Turner from Alabama. Moving
   into political office was a natural continuation of the leadership
   roles they had held in their former communities.

   By the end of Reconstruction in 1877, more than two thousand African
   American men had served in offices ranging from local levee
   commissioner to U.S. senator.^[54]12 When the end of Reconstruction
   returned white Democrats to power in the South, all but a few African
   American officeholders lost their positions. After Reconstruction,
   African Americans did not enter the political arena again in large
   numbers until well into the twentieth century.


                      III. The Meaning of Black Freedom

   Land was one of the major desires of the freed people. Frustrated by
   responsibility for the growing numbers of freed people following his
   troops, General William T. Sherman issued Special Field Order No. 15,
   in which land in Georgia and South Carolina was to be set aside as a
   homestead for the freedpeople. Sherman lacked the authority to
   confiscate and distribute land, so this plan never fully took
   effect.^[55]13 One of the main purposes of the Freedmen's Bureau,
   however, was to redistribute lands to formerly enslaved people that had
   been abandoned and confiscated by the federal government. Even these
   land grants were short-lived. In 1866, land that ex-Confederates had
   left behind was reinstated to them.

   Freedpeople's hopes of land reform were unceremoniously dashed as
   Freedmen's Bureau agents held meetings with the freedmen throughout the
   South, telling them the promise of land was not going to be honored and
   that instead they should plan to go back to work for their former
   enslaver as wage laborers. The policy reversal came as quite a shock.
   In one instance, Freedmen's Bureau commissioner General Oliver O.
   Howard went to Edisto Island to inform the Black population there of
   the policy change. The Black commission's response was that "we were
   promised Homesteads by the government. . . . You ask us to forgive the
   land owners of our island. . . .The man who tied me to a tree and gave
   me 39 lashes and who stripped and flogged my mother and my sister . . .
   that man I cannot well forgive. Does it look as if he has forgiven me,
   seeing how he tries to keep me in a condition of helplessness?"^[56]14

   In working to ensure that crops would be harvested, agents sometimes
   coerced formerly enslaved people into signing contracts with their
   former enslavers. However, the bureau also instituted courts where
   African Americans could seek redress if their employers were abusing
   them or not paying them. The last ember of hope for land redistribution
   was extinguished when Thaddeus Stevens and Charles Sumner's proposed
   land reform bills were tabled in Congress. Radicalism had its limits,
   and the Republican Party's commitment to economic stability eclipsed
   their interest in racial justice.

   Another aspect of the pursuit of freedom was the reconstitution of
   families. Many freedpeople immediately left plantations in search of
   family members who had been sold away. Newspaper ads sought information
   about long-lost relatives. People placed these ads until the turn of
   the twentieth century, demonstrating the enduring pursuit of family
   reunification. Freedpeople sought to gain control over their own
   children or other children who had been apprenticed to white masters
   either during the war or as a result of the Black Codes. Above all,
   freedpeople wanted freedom to control their families.^[57]15

   Many freedpeople rushed to solemnize unions with formal wedding
   ceremonies. Black people's desires to marry fit the government's goal
   to make free Black men responsible for their own households and to
   prevent Black women and children from becoming dependent on the
   government.

   Freedpeople placed a great emphasis on education for their children and
   themselves. For many, the ability to finally read the Bible for
   themselves induced work-weary men and women to spend all evening or
   Sunday attending night school or Sunday school classes. It was not
   uncommon to find a one-room school with more than fifty students
   ranging in age from three to eighty. As Booker T. Washington famously
   described the situation, "it was a whole race trying to go to school.
   Few were too young, and none too old, to make the attempt to
   learn."^[58]16

   Many churches served as schoolhouses and as a result became central to
   the freedom struggle. Free and freed Black southerners carried
   well-formed political and organizational skills into freedom. They
   developed anti-racist politics and organizational skills through
   antislavery organizations turned church associations. Liberated from
   white-controlled churches, Black Americans remade their religious
   worlds according to their own social and spiritual desires.^[59]17

   One of the more marked transformations that took place after
   emancipation was the proliferation of independent Black churches and
   church associations. In the 1930s, nearly 40 percent of 663 Black
   churches surveyed had their organizational roots in the
   post-emancipation era.^[60]18 Many independent Black churches emerged
   in the rural areas, and most of them had never been affiliated with
   white churches.

   Many of these independent churches were quickly organized into
   regional, state, and even national associations, often by brigades of
   free Black northerners and midwesterners who went to the South to help
   the freedmen. Through associations like the Virginia Baptist State
   Convention and the Consolidated American Baptist Missionary Convention,
   Baptists became the fastest growing post-emancipation denomination,
   building on their antislavery associational roots and carrying on the
   struggle for Black political participation.^[61]19

   Tensions between northerners and southerners over styles of worship and
   educational requirements strained these associations. Southern, rural
   Black churches preferred worship services with more emphasis on
   inspired preaching, while Black urban northerners favored more orderly
   worship and an educated ministry.

   Perhaps the most significant internal transformation in churches had to
   do with the role of women--a situation that eventually would lead to
   the development of independent women's conventions in Baptist,
   Methodist, and Pentecostal churches. Women like Nannie Helen Burroughs
   and Virginia Broughton, leaders of the Baptist Woman's Convention,
   worked to protect Black women from sexual violence from white men.
   Black representatives repeatedly articulated this concern in state
   constitutional conventions early in the Reconstruction era. In
   churches, women continued to fight for equal treatment and access to
   the pulpit as preachers, even though they were able to vote in church
   meetings.^[62]20

   Black churches provided centralized leadership and organization in
   post-emancipation communities. Many political leaders and officeholders
   were ministers. Churches were often the largest building in town and
   served as community centers. Access to pulpits and growing
   congregations provided a foundation for ministers' political
   leadership. Groups like the Union League, militias, and fraternal
   organizations all used the regalia, ritual, and even hymns of churches
   to inform and shape their practice.

   Black churches provided space for conflict over gender roles, cultural
   values, practices, norms, and political engagement. With the rise of
   Jim Crow, Black churches would enter a new phase of negotiating
   relationships within the community and the wider world.


                        IV. Reconstruction and Women

   [63]Photograph of Susan B. Anthony and Elizabeth Cady Stanton.

   Susan B. Anthony and Elizabeth Cady Stanton maintained a strong and
   productive relationship for nearly half a century as they sought to
   secure political rights for women. While the fight for women's rights
   stalled during the war, it sprung back to life as Anthony, Stanton, and
   others formed the American Equal Rights Association. [Elizabeth Cady
   Stanton, seated, and Susan B. Anthony, standing, three-quarter length
   portrait], between 1880 and 1902. [64]Library of Congress.
   Reconstruction involved more than the meaning of emancipation. Women
   also sought to redefine their roles within the nation and in their
   local communities. The abolitionist and women's rights movements
   simultaneously converged and began to clash. In the South, both Black
   and white women struggled to make sense of a world of death and change.
   In Reconstruction, leading women's rights advocate Elizabeth Cady
   Stanton saw an unprecedented opportunity for disenfranchised groups.
   Women as well as Black Americans, North and South, could seize
   political rights. Stanton formed the Women's Loyal National League in
   1863, which petitioned Congress for a constitutional amendment
   abolishing slavery.^[65]21 The Thirteenth Amendment marked a victory
   not only for the antislavery cause but also for the Loyal League,
   proving women's political efficacy and the possibility for radical
   change. Now, as Congress debated the meanings of freedom, equality, and
   citizenship for formerly enslaved people, women's rights leaders saw an
   opening to advance transformations in women's status, too. On May 10,
   1866, just one year after the war, the Eleventh National Women's Rights
   Convention met in New York City to discuss what many agreed was an
   extraordinary moment, full of promise for fundamental social change.
   Elizabeth Cady Stanton presided over the meeting. Also in attendance
   were prominent abolitionists with whom Stanton and other women's rights
   leaders had joined forces in the years leading up to the war.
   Addressing this crowd of social reformers, Stanton captured the radical
   spirit of the hour: "now in the reconstruction," she declared, "is the
   opportunity, perhaps for the century, to base our government on the
   broad principle of equal rights for all."^[66]22 Stanton chose her
   universal language--"equal rights for all"--with intention, setting an
   agenda of universal suffrage. Thus, in 1866, the National Women's
   Rights Convention officially merged with the American Anti-Slavery
   Society to form the American Equal Rights Association (AERA). This
   union marked the culmination of the long-standing partnership between
   abolitionists and women's rights advocates.

   The AERA was split over whether Black male suffrage should take
   precedence over universal suffrage, given the political climate of the
   South. Some worried that political support for freedmen would be
   undermined by the pursuit of women's suffrage. For example, AERA member
   Frederick Douglass insisted that the ballot was literally a "question
   of life and death" for southern Black men, but not for women.^[67]23
   Some African American women challenged white suffragists in other ways.
   Frances Harper, for example, a freeborn Black woman living in Ohio,
   urged them to consider their own privilege as white and middle class.
   Universal suffrage, she argued, would not so clearly address the
   complex difficulties posed by racial, economic, and gender
   inequality.^[68]24
   [69]Elizabeth Cady Stanton, the great women's rights and abolition
   activist, was one of the strongest forces in the universal suffrage
   movement. Her name can be seen at the top of this petition to extend
   suffrage to all regardless of sex, which was present to Congress on
   January 29, 1866. It did not pass, and women would not gain the vote
   for more than half a decade after Stanton and others signed this
   petition. "Petition of E. Cady Stanton, Susan B. Anthony, Lucy Stone,
   Antoinette Brown Blackwell, and Others Asking for an Amendment of the
   Constitution that Shall Prohibit the Several States from Disfranchising
   Any of Their Citizens on the Ground of Sex," 1865. National Archives
   and Records Administration,

   Any of Their Citizens on the Ground of Sex, 1865. [70]National Archives
   and Records Administration.

   These divisions came to a head early in 1867, as the AERA organized a
   campaign in Kansas to determine the fate of Black and woman suffrage.
   Elizabeth Cady Stanton and her partner in the movement, Susan B.
   Anthony, made the journey to advocate universal suffrage. Yet they soon
   realized that their allies were distancing themselves from women's
   suffrage in order to advance Black enfranchisement. Disheartened,
   Stanton and Anthony allied instead with white supremacists who
   supported women's equality. Many fellow activists were dismayed by
   Stanton's and Anthony's willingness to appeal to racism to advance
   their cause.^[71]25

   These tensions finally erupted over conflicting views of the Fourteenth
   and Fifteenth Amendments. Women's rights leaders vigorously protested
   the Fourteenth Amendment. Although it established national citizenship
   for all persons born or naturalized in the United States, the amendment
   also introduced the word male into the Constitution for the first time.
   After the Fifteenth Amendment ignored sex as an unlawful barrier to
   suffrage, an omission that appalled Stanton, the AERA officially
   dissolved. Stanton and Anthony formed the National Woman Suffrage
   Association (NWSA), while suffragists who supported the Fifteenth
   Amendment, regardless of its limitations, founded the American Woman
   Suffrage Association (AWSA).

   The NWSA soon rallied around a new strategy: the New Departure. This
   new approach interpreted the Constitution as already guaranteeing women
   the right to vote. They argued that by nationalizing citizenship for
   all people and protecting all rights of citizens--including the right
   to vote--the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments guaranteed women's
   suffrage. Broadcasting the New Departure, the NWSA encouraged women to
   register to vote, which roughly seven hundred did between 1868 and
   1872. Susan B. Anthony was one of them and was arrested but then
   acquitted in trial. In 1875, the Supreme Court addressed this
   constitutional argument: acknowledging women's citizenship but arguing
   that suffrage was not a right guaranteed to all citizens. This ruling
   not only defeated the New Departure but also coincided with the Court's
   broader reactionary interpretation of the Reconstruction amendments
   that significantly limited freedmen's rights. Following this defeat,
   many suffragists like Stanton increasingly replaced the ideal of
   universal suffrage with arguments about the virtue that white women
   would bring to the polls. These new arguments often hinged on racism
   and declared the necessity of white women voters to keep Black men in
   check.^[72]26

   Advocates for women's suffrage were largely confined to the North, but
   southern women were experiencing social transformations as well. The
   lines between refined white womanhood and degraded enslaved Black
   femaleness were no longer so clearly defined. Moreover, during the war,
   southern white women had been called on to do traditional men's work,
   chopping wood and managing businesses. While white southern women
   decided whether and how to return to their prior status, African
   American women embraced new freedoms and a redefinition of womanhood.
   [73]The Fifteenth Amendment gave male citizens, regardless of race,
   color, or previous status (i.e. slavery), the right to vote. While the
   amendment was not all encompassing in that women were not included, it
   was an extremely significant ruling in establishing the liberties of
   African American men. This print depicts a huge parade held in
   Baltimore, Maryland, on May 19, 1870, surrounded by portraits of
   abolitionists and scenes of African Americans exercising their rights.

   The Civil War showed white women, especially upper-class women, life
   without their husbands' protection. Many did not like what they saw,
   especially given the possibility of racial equality. Formerly wealthy
   women hoped to maintain their social status by rebuilding the prewar
   social hierarchy. Through Ladies' Memorial Associations and other civic
   groups, southern women led the efforts to bury and memorialize the
   dead, praising and bolstering their men's masculinity through
   nationalist speeches and memorials. Ladies' Memorial Associations
   (LMAs) grew out of the Soldiers' Aid Society and became the precursor
   and custodian of the Lost Cause narrative. Proponents of the Lost Cause
   tried to rewrite the history of the antebellum South to deemphasize the
   brutality of slavery. They also created the myth that the Civil War was
   fought over states' rights instead of slavery, which was the actual
   cause. LMAs and their ceremonies created new holidays during which
   white southerners could reaffirm their allegiance to the Confederacy
   and express their opposition to Black rights. For instance, some LMAs
   celebrated the anniversary of Stonewall Jackson's death on May
   10.^[75]27 Through these activities, southern women took on political
   roles in the South.

   Southern Black women also sought to redefine their public and private
   lives. Their efforts to control their labor met the immediate
   opposition of southern white women. Gertrude Clanton, a plantation
   mistress before the war, disliked cooking and washing dishes, so she
   hired an African American woman to do the washing. A misunderstanding
   quickly developed. The laundress, nameless in Gertrude's records,
   performed her job and returned home. Gertrude believed that her money
   had purchased a day's labor, not just the load of washing, and she
   became quite frustrated. Meanwhile, this washerwoman and others like
   her set wages and hours for themselves, and in many cases began to take
   washing into their own homes in order to avoid the surveillance of
   white women and the sexual threat posed by white men.^[76]28

   Similar conflicts raged across the South. White southerners demanded
   that African American women work in the plantation home and instituted
   apprenticeship systems to place African American children in unpaid
   labor positions. African American women combated these attempts by
   refusing to work at jobs without fair pay or fair conditions and by
   clinging tightly to their children.

   Like white LMA members, African American women formed clubs to bury
   their dead, to celebrate African American masculinity, and to provide
   aid to their communities. On May 1, 1865, African Americans in
   Charleston created the precursor to the modern Memorial Day by mourning
   the Union dead buried hastily on a race track turned prison.^[77]29
   Like their white counterparts, the three hundred African American women
   who participated had been members of the local Patriotic Association,
   which aided freedpeople during the war. African American women
   continued participating in federal Decoration Day ceremonies and,
   later, formed their own club organizations. Racial violence, whether
   city riots or rural vigilantes, continued to threaten these vulnerable
   households. Nevertheless, the formation and preservation of African
   American households became a paramount goal for African American women.

   For all of their differences, white and Black southern women faced a
   similar challenge during Reconstruction. Southern women celebrated the
   return of their brothers, husbands, and sons, but couples separated for
   many years struggled to adjust. To make matters worse, many of these
   former soldiers returned with physical or mental wounds. For white
   families, suicide and divorce became more acceptable, while the
   opposite occurred for Black families. Since the entire South suffered
   from economic devastation, many families were impoverished and sank
   into debt. All southern women faced economic devastation, lasting
   wartime trauma, and enduring racial tensions.


                    V. Racial Violence in Reconstruction

   Violence shattered the dream of biracial democracy. Still steeped in
   the violence of slavery, white southerners could scarcely imagine Black
   free labor. Congressional investigator Carl Schurz reported that in the
   summer of 1865, southerners shared a near unanimous sentiment that "You
   cannot make the negro work, without physical compulsion."^[78]30
   Violence had been used in the antebellum period to enforce slave labor
   and to define racial difference. In the post-emancipation period it was
   used to stifle Black advancement and return to the old order.

   Much of life in the antebellum South had been premised on slavery. The
   social order rested on a subjugated underclass, and the labor system
   required unfree laborers. A notion of white supremacy and Black
   inferiority undergirded it all. White people were understood as fit for
   freedom and citizenship, Black people for chattel slave labor. The
   Confederate surrender at Appomattox Court House and the subsequent
   adoption by the U.S. Congress of the Thirteenth Amendment destroyed the
   institution of American slavery and threw southern society into
   disarray. The foundation of southern society had been shaken, but
   southern whites used Black Codes and racial terrorism to reassert
   control over formerly enslaved people.
   [79]This Harper's Weekly print shows a member of the Ku Klux Klan
   firing a gun into a Black home.

   The Ku Klux Klan was just one of a number of vigilante groups that
   arose after the war to terrorize African Americans and Republicans
   throughout the South. The KKK brought violence into the voting polls,
   the workplace, and -- as seen in this Harper's Weekly print -- the
   homes of Black Americans. Frank Bellew, Visit of the
   Ku-Klux,"1872. [80]Wikimedia.

   Racial violence in the Reconstruction period took three major forms:
   riots against Black political authority, interpersonal fights, and
   organized vigilante groups. There were riots in southern cities several
   times during Reconstruction. The most notable were the riots in Memphis
   and New Orleans in 1866, but other large-scale urban conflicts erupted
   in places including Laurens, South Carolina, in 1870; Colfax,
   Louisiana, in 1873; another in New Orleans in 1874; Yazoo City,
   Mississippi, in 1875; and Hamburg, South Carolina, in 1876. Southern
   cities grew rapidly after the war as migrants from the
   countryside--particularly freed people--flocked to urban centers.
   Cities became centers of Republican control. But white conservatives
   chafed at the influx of Black residents and the establishment of
   biracial politics. In nearly every conflict, white conservatives
   initiated violence in reaction to Republican rallies or conventions or
   elections in which Black men were to vote. The death tolls of these
   conflicts remain incalculable, and victims were overwhelmingly Black.

   Even everyday violence between individuals disproportionally targeted
   African Americans during Reconstruction. African Americans gained
   citizenship rights like the ability to serve on juries as a result of
   the Civil Rights Act of 1866 and the Fourteenth Amendment. But southern
   white men were almost never prosecuted for violence against Black
   victims. White men beat or shot Black men with relative impunity, and
   did so over minor squabbles, labor disputes, long-standing grudges, and
   crimes of passion. These incidents sometimes were reported to local
   federal authorities like the army or the Freedmen's Bureau, but more
   often than not such violence was unreported and unprosecuted.^[81]31

   The violence committed by organized vigilante groups, sometimes called
   nightriders or bushwhackers, was more often premeditated. Groups of
   nightriders operated under cover of darkness and wore disguises to
   curtail Black political involvement. Nightriders harassed and killed
   Black candidates and officeholders and frightened voters away from the
   polls. They also aimed to limit Black economic mobility by terrorizing
   freedpeople who tried to purchase land or otherwise become too
   independent from the white enslavers they used to rely on. They were
   terrorists and vigilantes, determined to stop the erosion of the
   antebellum South, and they were widespread and numerous, operating
   throughout the South. The Ku Klux Klan emerged in the late 1860s as the
   most infamous of these groups.

   The Ku Klux Klan (KKK) was organized in 1866 in Pulaski, Tennessee, and
   had spread to nearly every state of the former Confederacy by 1868. The
   Klan drew heavily from the antebellum southern elite, but Klan groups
   sometimes overlapped with criminal gangs or former Confederate
   guerrilla groups. The Klan's reputation became so potent, and its
   violence so widespread, that many groups not formally associated with
   it were called Ku Kluxers, and to "Ku Klux" meant to commit vigilante
   violence. While it is difficult to differentiate Klan actions from
   those of similar groups, such as the White Line, the Knights of the
   White Camellia, and the White Brotherhood, the distinctions hardly
   matter. All such groups were part of a web of terror that spread
   throughout the South during Reconstruction. In Panola County,
   Mississippi, between August 1870 and December 1872, twenty-four
   Klan-style murders occurred. And nearby, in Lafayette County, Klansmen
   drowned thirty Black Mississippians in a single mass murder. Sometimes
   the violence was aimed at Black men or women who had tried to buy land
   or dared to be insolent toward a white southerner. Other times, as with
   the beating of Republican sheriff and tax collector Allen Huggins, the
   Klan targeted white politicians who supported freedpeople's civil
   rights. Numerous Republican politicians, perhaps dozens, were killed,
   either while in office or while campaigning. Thousands of individual
   citizens, men and women, white and Black, had their homes raided and
   were whipped, raped, or murdered.^[82]32

   The federal government responded to southern paramilitary tactics by
   passing the Enforcement Acts between 1870 and 1871. The acts made it
   criminal to deprive African Americans of their civil rights. The acts
   also deemed violent Klan behavior as acts of rebellion against the
   United States and allowed for the use of U.S. troops to protect
   freedpeople. For a time, the federal government, its courts, and its
   troops, sought to put an end to the KKK and related groups. But the
   violence continued. By 1876, as southern Democrats reestablished "home
   rule" and "redeemed" the South from Republicans, federal opposition to
   the KKK weakened. National attention shifted away from the South and
   the activities of the Klan, but African Americans remained trapped in a
   world of white supremacy that restricted their economic, social, and
   political rights.
   [83]This Harper's Weekly print shows a soldier in the Freedmen's Bureau
   standing between a group or armed and angry white men and a group of
   Black men.

   The federal government created the Freedmen's Bureau to assist freed
   people in securing their rights and their livelihoods. In this Harper's
   Weekly print, The Freedmen's Bureau official protecting the Black men
   and women from the angry and riotous mob of white Americans stood as a
   representation of the entire Bureau. Soon the Bureau and the federal
   government would recognize that they could not accomplish a fraction of
   what they set out to do, including keeping African Americans safe and
   free in the South. Alfred R. Waud, The Freedmen's Bureau,
   1868. [84]Library of Congress.

   White conservatives would assert that Republicans, in denouncing
   violence, were "waving a bloody shirt" for political opportunity. The
   violence, according to many white conservatives, was fabricated, or not
   as bad as it was claimed, or an unavoidable consequence of the
   enfranchisement of African Americans. On December 22, 1871, R. Latham
   of Yorkville, South Carolina, wrote to the New York Tribune, voicing
   the beliefs of many white southerners as he declared that "the same
   principle that prompted the white men at Boston, disguised as Indians,
   to board, during the darkness of night, a vessel with tea, and throw
   her cargo into the Bay, clothed some of our people in Ku Klux gowns,
   and sent them out on missions technically illegal. Did the Ku Klux do
   wrong? You are ready to say they did and we will not argue the point
   with you. . . . Under the peculiar circumstances what could the people
   of South Carolina do but resort to Ku Kluxing?"^[85]33

   Victims and witnesses to the violence told a different story. Sallie
   Adkins of Warren County, Georgia, was traveling with her husband,
   Joseph, a Georgia state senator, when he was assassinated by Klansmen
   on May 10, 1869. She wrote President Ulysses S. Grant, asking for both
   physical protection and justice. "I am no Statesman," she disclaimed;
   "I am only a poor woman whose husband has been murdered for his
   devotion to his country. I may have very foolish ideas of Government,
   States & Constitutions. But I feel that I have claims upon my country.
   The Rebels imprisoned my Husband. Pardoned Rebels murdered him. There
   is no law for the punishment of them who do deeds of this sort. . . . I
   demand that you, President Grant, keep the pledge you made the
   nation--make it safe for any man to utter boldly and openly his
   devotion to the United States."^[86]34

   The political and social consequences of the violence were as lasting
   as the physical and mental trauma suffered by victims and witnesses.
   Terrorism worked to end federal involvement in Reconstruction and
   helped to usher in a new era of racial repression.

   African Americans actively sought ways to shed the vestiges of slavery.
   Many discarded the names their former enslavers had chosen for them and
   adopted new names like "Freeman" and "Lincoln" that affirmed their new
   identities as free citizens. Others resettled far from their former
   plantations, hoping to eventually farm their own land or run their own
   businesses. By the end of Reconstruction, the desire for
   self-definition, economic independence, and racial pride coalesced in
   the founding of dozens of Black towns across the South. Perhaps the
   most well-known of these towns was Mound Bayou, Mississippi, a Delta
   town established in 1887 by Isaiah Montgomery and Ben Green, formerly
   enslaved by Joseph and Jefferson Davis. Residents of the town took
   pride in the fact that African Americans owned all of the property in
   town, including banks, insurance companies, shops, and the surrounding
   farms. The town celebrated African American cultural and economic
   achievements during their annual festival, Mound Bayou Days. These
   tight-knit communities provided African Americans with spaces where
   they could live free from the indignities of segregation and the
   exploitation of sharecropping on white-owned plantations.^[87]35


      VI. Economic Development during the Civil War and Reconstruction

   Congress.

   The Civil War destroyed and then transformed the American economy. In
   1859 and 1860, wealthy southern planters were flush after producing
   record cotton crops. Southern prosperity relied on over four million
   enslaved African American to grow cotton, along with a number of other
   staple crops across the region. Cotton fed the textile mills of America
   and Europe and brought great wealth to the region. On the eve of war,
   the American South enjoyed more per capita wealth than any other slave
   economy in the New World. To their enslavers, these people constituted
   their most valuable assets, worth roughly $3 billion.^[90]36 Yet this
   wealth obscured the gains in infrastructure, industrial production, and
   financial markets that occurred north of the Mason-Dixon Line, a fact
   that the war would unmask for all to see.

   In contrast to the slave South, northerners praised their region as a
   land of free labor, populated by farmers, merchants, and wage laborers.
   It was also home to a robust market economy. By 1860, northerners could
   buy clothing made in a New England factory, or light their homes with
   kerosene oil from Pennsylvania. The Midwest produced seas of grain that
   fed the country, with enough left over for export to Europe. Farther
   west, mining and agriculture were the mainstays of life. Along with the
   textile mills, shoe factories, and iron foundries, the firms that
   produced McCormick's wheat harvesters and Colt's firearms displayed the
   technical advances of northern manufacturers. Their goods crisscrossed
   the country on the North's growing railroad network. An extensive
   network of banks and financial markets helped aggregate capital that
   could be reinvested into further growth.

   The Civil War, like all wars, interrupted the rhythms of commercial
   life by destroying lives and property. This was especially true in the
   South. From 1861 onward, the Confederate government struggled to find
   the guns, food, and supplies needed to field an army. Southerners did
   make astonishing gains in industrial production during this time, but
   it was never enough. The Union's blockade of the Atlantic prevented the
   Confederacy from financing the war with cotton sales to Europe. To pay
   their troops and keep the economy alive, the Confederate Congress
   turned to printing paper money that quickly sank in value and led to
   rapid inflation. In many cases, Confederate officials dispensed with
   taxes paid in cash and simply impressed the food and materials needed
   from their citizens. Perhaps most striking of all, in the vast
   agricultural wealth of the South, many southerners struggled to find
   enough to eat.

   The war also pushed the U.S. government to take unprecedented steps.
   Congress raised tariffs and passed the first national income tax in
   1862. In late 1861, Congress created the nation's first fiat currency,
   called greenbacks. At first, the expansion of the currency and the
   rapid rise in government spending created an uptick in business in
   1862-1863. As the war dragged on, inflation also hit the North. Workers
   demanded higher wages to pay rents and buy necessities, while the
   business community groaned under their growing tax burden. The United
   States, however, never embarked on a policy of impressment for food and
   supplies. The factories and farms of the North successfully supplied
   Union troops, while the federal government, with some adjustments,
   found the means to pay for war. None of this is to suggest that the
   North's superior ability to supply its war machine made the outcome of
   the war inevitable. Any account of the war must consider the tangled
   web of politics, battles, and economics that occurred between 1861 and
   1865. But the aftermath of the war left portions of the Confederacy in
   ruins. State governments were mired in debt. White planters had most of
   their capital tied up in enslaved laborers, and so lost most of their
   wealth. Cotton remained the most significant crop, but the war changed
   how it was grown and sold. Planters broke up large farms into smaller
   plots tended by single families in exchange for a portion of the crop,
   a system called sharecropping. Once cotton production resumed,
   Americans found that their cotton now competed with new cotton
   plantations around the world. For the South as a whole, the war and
   Reconstruction marked the start of a period of deep poverty that would
   last until at least the New Deal of the 1930s.

   War brought destruction across the South. Governmental and private
   buildings, communication systems, the economy, and transportation
   infrastructure were all debilitated. [Richmond, Va. Crippled
   locomotive, Richmond & Petersburg Railroad depot], c. 1865. [92]Library
   of Congress.
   Emancipation was the single most important economic, social, and
   political outcome of the war. Freedom empowered African Americans in
   the South to rebuild families, make contracts, hold property, and move
   freely for the first time. Republicans in the South attempted to
   transform the region into a free-labor economy like the North. Yet the
   transition from slave labor to free labor was never so clear. Well into
   the twentieth century, white southerners used a combination of legal
   coercion and extralegal violence to maintain systems of bound labor.
   Vagrancy laws enabled law enforcement to justify the arrest of innocent
   Black men and women, and the convict-lease system meant that arbitrary
   arrests often resulted in decades of forced, uncompensated labor. But
   this new form of servitude, which continued until World War II, was
   only the most extreme example of an array of economic injustices. In
   the later nineteenth century, poor whites would form mobs and go
   "white-capping" to scare away Black job seekers.^[93]37 Lacking the
   means to buy their own farms, Black farmers often turned to
   sharecropping. Sharecropping often led to cycles of debt that kept
   families bound to the land.^[94]38

   Victory did not produce a sudden economic boom for the rest of the
   United States, either. The North would not regain its prewar pace of
   industrial and commodity output until the 1870s. But the war did prove
   beneficial to wealthy northern farmers who could afford new
   technologies. Wartime labor shortages promoted the use of mechanical
   reapers, reducing demand for labor, boosting farm yields, and sowing
   the seeds of inequality.
   [95]Sketch of Massachusetts Agricultural College (now known as the
   University of Massachusetts Amherst).

   Massachusetts Agricultural College (now known as the University of
   Massachusetts Amherst) was one of many colleges founded through the
   Federal Morrill-Land Grant Colleges Act. Massachusetts Agricultural
   College, Amherst, Mass. 1879, 1880. [96]Wikimedia.

   Wartime laws also transformed the relationship between the federal
   government and the American economy. New tariff laws sheltered northern
   industry from European competition. The Morrill Land Grant helped
   create colleges such as the University of California, the University of
   Illinois, and the University of Wisconsin. With the creation of the
   national banking system and greenbacks, Congress replaced hundreds of
   state bank notes with a system of federal currency that accelerated
   trade and exchange. This was not to say that Republican policy worked
   for everyone. The Homestead Act, meant to open the West to small
   farmers, was often frustrated by railroad corporations and speculators.
   The Transcontinental Railroad, launched during the war, failed to
   produce substantial economic gains for years.

   The war years forged a close relationship between government and the
   business elite, a relationship that sometimes resulted in corruption
   and catastrophe, as it did when markets crashed on Black Friday,
   September 24, 1869. This new relationship created a political backlash,
   especially in the West and South, against Washington's perceived
   eastern and industrial bias. Conflicts over emancipation and civil
   rights quickly gave way to long political conflict over the direction
   of American economic development.


                       VII. The End of Reconstruction

   Reconstruction ended when northerners abandoned the cause of the
   formerly enslaved and Democrats recaptured southern politics. Between
   1868 and 1877, and especially after the Depression of 1873, economic
   issues supplanted Reconstruction as the foremost issue on the national
   agenda. The biggest threat to Republican power in the South had been
   the violence and intimidation of white Democrats. Only the presence of
   federal troops in key southern cities prevented Reconstruction's quick
   collapse. But the United States never committed the personnel required
   to restore order and guarantee Black southerners the rights promised by
   the Fourteenth Amendment.

   Republicans and Democrats responded to economic uncertainty by
   retreating from Reconstruction. War-weary from a decade of military and
   political strife, so-called Stalwart Republicans turned from the
   idealism of civil rights to the practicality of economics and party
   politics. They won particular influence during Ulysses S. Grant's first
   term as president (1868-1872). By the early 1870s, Stalwart Republicans
   assumed control of Republican Party politics.

   Meanwhile, New Departure Democrats--who focused on business, economics,
   political corruption, and trade--gained strength by distancing
   themselves from pro-slavery Democrats and Copperheads. In the South,
   they were called Redeemers. White southerners initially opposed the
   Redeemers and instead clung tightly to white supremacy and the
   Confederacy, but between 1869 and 1871, the Redeemers won support from
   white southerners by promising local rule by white Democrats, rather
   than Black or white Republicans. By 1871, Redeemers won political
   control and ended Reconstruction in three important states: Tennessee,
   Virginia, and Georgia.

   In September 1873, Jay Cooke and Company declared bankruptcy, resulting
   in a bank run that spiraled into a six-year depression. The Depression
   of 1873 crushed the nation's already suffering laboring class and
   destroyed whatever remaining idealism northerners had about
   Reconstruction. In the South, where many farms were capitalized
   entirely through loans, sources of credit vanished, many landowners
   defaulted, and farmers entered an already oversaturated labor market.
   Wages plummeted and a growing system of debt peonage trapped workers in
   endless cycles of poverty. The economic turmoil enabled the Democrats
   to take control of the House of Representatives after the 1874
   elections, blunting the legislature's capacity to any longer direct
   Reconstruction.

   During the Panic of 1873, workers began demanding that the federal
   government help alleviate the strain on Americans. In January 1874,
   over 7,000 protesters congregated in New York City's Tompkins Square to
   insist the government make job creation a priority. They were met with
   brutality as police dispersed the crowd, and consequently the
   unemployment movement lost much of its steam. Matt Morgen, Print of a
   crowd driven from Tompkins Square by the mounted police, in the
   Tompkins Square Riot of 1874, January 1874. [98]Wikimedia.

   On the eve of the 1876 presidential election, the nation still reeled
   from depression. Scandals sapped trust in the Grant Administration. By
   1875, Democrats in Mississippi hatched the Mississippi Plan, a wave of
   violence designed to intimidate Black activists and suppress Black
   voters.^[99]39 The state's Republican governor pleaded for federal
   intervention, but national Republicans ignored the plea. Meanwhile,
   Rutherford B. Hayes, a Republican, won a landslide victory in the Ohio
   gubernatorial election without mentioning Reconstruction, focusing
   instead on fighting corruption and alcohol abuse and promoting economic
   recovery. His success made him a potential presidential candidate. The
   stage was set for an election that would end Reconstruction as a
   national issue.

   Republicans chose Rutherford B. Hayes as their nominee; Democrats chose
   Samuel J. Tilden, who ran on honest politics and home rule in the
   South. Florida, Louisiana, and South Carolina would determine the
   president. Despite the enduring presence of Reconstruction in those
   states, white conservatives organized violence and fraud with impunity.
   With the election results contested, a federal special electoral
   commission voted along party lines--eight Republicans for, seven
   Democrats against--in favor of Hayes.

   Democrats threatened to boycott Hayes's inauguration. Rival governments
   arose claiming to recognize Tilden as the rightfully elected president.
   Republicans, fearing another sectional crisis, reached out to
   Democrats. In what became known as the Compromise of 1877, Democrats
   conceded the presidency to Hayes on the condition that all remaining
   troops would be removed from the South and the South would receive
   special economic favors. Hayes was inaugurated in March 1877. In April,
   the remaining troops were ordered out of the South. The compromise
   allowed southern Democrats, no longer fearing reprisal from federal
   troops or northern politicians for their flagrant violence and
   intimidation of Black voters, to return to power.

   After 1877, Republicans no longer had the political capital--or
   political will--to intervene in the South in cases of violence and
   electoral fraud. In certain locations with large populations of African
   Americans, such as South Carolina, freedpeople continued to hold some
   local offices for several years. Yet, with its most revolutionary aims
   thwarted by 1868, and economic depression and political turmoil taking
   even its most modest promises off the table by the early 1870s, most of
   the promises of Reconstruction were unmet.

                              VIII. Conclusion

   Reconstruction in the United States achieved Abraham Lincoln's
   paramount desire: the restoration of the Union. The war and its
   aftermath forever ended legal slavery in the United States, but African
   Americans remained second-class citizens and women still struggled for
   full participation in the public life of the United States. The closing
   of Reconstruction saw North and South reunited behind the imperatives
   of economic growth and territorial expansion, rather than ensuring the
   full rights of its citizens. From the ashes of civil war, a new nation
   faced fresh possibilities while enduring old problems.

   [100]1. Freedmen discuss post-emancipation life with General Sherman,
   1865

   Reconstruction began before the War ended. After his famous March to
   the Sea in January of 1865, General William T. Sherman and Secretary of
   War Edwin Stanton met with twenty of Savannah's African American
   religious leaders to discuss the future of the freedmen of the state of
   Georgia. In the excerpt below, Garrison Frazier, the chosen spokesman
   for the group, explains the importance of land for freedom. The result
   of this meeting was Sherman's famous Field Order 15, which set aside
   confiscated plantation lands along the coast from Charleston, S.C. to
   Jacksonville, FL. for Black land ownership. The policy would later be
   overruled and freedpeople would lose their right to the land.

   [101]2. Jourdon Anderson writes his former enslaver, 1865

   Black Americans hoped that the end of the Civil War would create an
   entirely new world, while white southerners tried to restore the
   antebellum order as much as they could. Most enslavers sought to
   maintain control over their formerly enslaved laborers through
   sharecropping contracts. P.H. Anderson of Tennessee was one such former
   enslaver. After the war, he contacted his formerly enslaved laborer
   Jourdon Anderson, offering him a job opportunity. The following is
   Jourdon Anderson's reply.

   [102]3. Charlotte Forten teaches freed children in South Carolina, 1864

   Charlotte Forten was born into a wealthy Black family in Philadelphia.
   After receiving an education in Salem, Massachusetts, Forten became the
   first Black American hired to teach white students. She lent her
   educational expertise to the war effort by relocating to South Carolina
   in 1862 with the goal of educating formerly enslaved people. This
   excerpt from her diary explains her experiences during this time.

   [103]4. Mississippi Black Code, 1865

   Many southern governments enacted legislation that reestablished
   antebellum power relationships. South Carolina and Mississippi passed
   laws known as Black Codes to regulate Black behavior and impose social
   and economic control. While they granted some rights to African
   Americans - like the right to own property, to marry or to make
   contracts - they also denied other fundamental rights. Mississippi's
   vagrant law, excerpted here, required all freedmen to carry papers
   proving they had means of employment. If they had no proof, they could
   be arrested, fined, or even re-enslaved and leased out to their former
   enslaver.

   [104]5. General Reynolds describes lawlessness in Texas, 1868

   Most histories of the Civil War claim that the war ended in the summer
   of 1865 when Confederate armies surrendered. However, violent
   resistance and terrorism continued in the South for over a decade. In
   this report, General J.J. Reynolds describes the lawlessness of Texas
   during Reconstruction.

   [105]6. A case of sexual violence during Reconstruction, 1866

   These documents chronicle a case in the wider wave of violence that
   targeted people of color during Reconstruction. The first document
   includes Frances Thompson and Lucy Smith's testimony about their
   assault, rape, and robbery in 1866. The second document, demonstrates
   one way that white Southerners denied these claims. In 1876, Thompson
   was exposed for cross-dressing. For twenty years she successfully
   passed as a woman. Southerners trumpeted this case as evidence that
   widely documented cases of violence, sexual and otherwise, were
   fabricated.

   [106]7. Frederick Douglass on remembering the Civil War, 1877

   Americans came together after the Civil War largely by collectively
   forgetting what the war was about. Celebrations honored the bravery of
   both armies, and the meaning of the war faded. Frederick Douglass and
   other Black leaders engaged with Confederate sympathizers in a battle
   of historical memory. In this speech, Douglass calls on Americans to
   remember the war for what it was--a struggle between an army fighting
   to protect slavery and a nation reluctantly transformed into a force
   for liberation.

   [107]8. Johnson and Reconstruction cartoon, 1866

   This print mocks Reconstruction by making several allusions to
   Shakespeare. The center illustration shows a Black soldier as Othello
   and President Andrew Johnson as Iago. Johnson's slogans "Treason is a
   crime and must be made odious" and "I am your Moses" are on the wall.
   The top left shows a riot in Memphis and at the top a riot in New
   Orleans. At the bottom, Johnson is trying to charm a Confederate
   Copperhead. General Benjamin Butler is at the bottom left, accepting
   the Confederate surrender of New Orleans in 1862. This scene is
   contrasted to the bottom right where General Philips Sheridan bows to
   Louisiana Attorney General Andrew Herron in 1866, implying a defeat
   for Reconstruction. Click on the image for more information.

   [108]9. Fifteenth Amendment print, 1870

   This 1870 print celebrated the passage of the Fifteenth Amendment. Here
   we see several of the themes most important to Black Americans during
   Reconstruction: The print celebrates the military achievements of Black
   veterans, the voting rights protected by the amendment, the right to
   marry and establish families, the creation and protection of Black
   churches, and the right to own and improve land. Unfortunately, many of
   these freedoms would be short-lived as the United States retreated from
   Reconstruction.

Students demand action after reports of racist Snapchat post

December 14, 2022

   By Mercy Austin and Scout Hudson

Update: On Dec. 14, Mizzou Students for Life told The Maneater that Megan
Miller is no longer a member of its executive board as of Dec. 8 with the
following statement:

"Mizzou SFL believes all life is valuable and rejects prejudice against
people based on age, sex, race, stage of development, perceptions of
abilities, or income."

   On Dec. 7, a screenshot was posted in a group chat between many Black
   students on the MU campus.  The screenshot displayed an alleged
   Snapchat post of MU student Megan Miller using a racial slur and
   promoting violence toward Black people, and it quickly circulated via
   social media. It is unknown when the post was originally created.

   According to Miller's LinkedIn, which has since been deleted, she
   served as the president of the MU chapter of Turning Point USA but
   resigned "without explanation" last week, as reported to The Kansas
   City Star from the national branch of Turning Point USA.

   In the same correspondence with the Kansas City Star, TPUSA stated,
   "this kind of language has no place at TPUSA, and we support her
   decision to remove herself from all involvement with that local
   chapter."

   Miller also acted as the vice president of public relations for Mizzou
   Students for Life. It is unclear whether Miller will continue to serve
   in that position, as MUSFL has not responded to The Maneater's request
   for comment.

   Jeremiah Jordan, the executive adviser of the Black Collegiate Network,
   said it was disheartening to see the post, especially coming from a
   student who had executive positions on campus.

   "A lot of us want to call Mizzou home," Jordan said. "A lot of us have
   our best friends here and have met many great people here. But then
   there's the flip side of that -- we have so much racism and so much
   hate speech spewed all over campus at all times. It's scary to think
   about all these people going around hating, hating us for our color and
   for literally no reason at all. They don't even know who we are."

   Jordan frequently witnesses what he describes as routine acts of racism
   on campus, with some of these incidents having affected him firsthand.

   "A lot of the experiences I've had deal with microaggressions, like
   people trying to touch my braids," Jordan said.

   According to Jordan, many people on the MU campus have had similar
   experiences.  In 2020, many Black students shared their experiences
   with racism and microaggressions on campus through the hashtag
   #blackatmizzou.

   "It's gross to think that it's a normal occurrence at Mizzou," Jordan
   said.

   Additional screenshots from Miller's now-deleted Instagram page show
   her at a Turning Point USA conference standing with Kyle Rittenhouse,
   who shot three men on Oct. 25, 2020 at a Black Lives Matter protest in
   Kenosha, Wisconsin.

   "[The post] made me really uncomfortable, especially because the
   caption was something like `best day of my life'," said Kaylyn Walker,
   who serves as a Senator with the Legion of Black Collegians.  "It was
   really uncomfortable for me, especially as a person of color."

   Miller's post is currently under review by the Office of Institutional
   Equity, according to MU News Bureau Director Christian Basi. As
   explained by Basi, the process entails contacting all involved
   individuals and investigating the context of the post.

   An MU [41]press release condemned the post and said that following the
   review, the university will take immediate action.

   "The language is reprehensible, and we condemn any language and actions
   that are racist, discriminatory, and hateful to our community," UM
   System President and MU Chancellor Mun Choi said.

   Some students have expressed concern that the report will eventually be
   dismissed.

   "I have friends that have filed reports [to the Office of Institutional
   Equity] and it has not been taken seriously. No type of realistic
   action has been taken," said Walker. "I know a lot of people who have
   been in that situation and don't really feel like going through the
   process just to be disappointed once again."

   Miller's post comes after another instance of white supremacist
   displays on MU's campus earlier this semester.

   On Oct. 24, posters were put up around campus displaying white
   supremacist rhetoric and using the "14 words," a known dog whistle
   within white supremacist spaces. The posters also included links to a
   white power website.

   In response to the posters, students formed [42]Mizzou Fails, a
   coalition that presented a three-tiered list of demands to the
   administration. Upper-tier demands advocated for the diversification of
   MU faculty and other infrastructural changes. Tier-one demands called
   for MU to launch an investigation into the posters, to punish the
   individuals responsible for their creation and distribution, and
   finally, for Choi to issue a statement denouncing white supremacy and
   apologize to students for not acting sooner.

   On Nov. 10, Choi responded with [43]an email condemning racism and
   discrimination, but there was no direct acknowledgment of the posters
   nor explicit condemnation of the content they promoted.

   The MU Faculty Council, an elected representative organization of MU
   professors, released a statement on Nov. 10 in which it condemned the
   content of the posters and acknowledged that the messages were
   inconsistent with MU's values.

   According to the statement, "While posting the flyers may not violate
   university policies on free speech, it is important to acknowledge that
   the flyers display messages of hate, which have been associated with a
   history of racist violence in the U.S."

   Four days later, a [44]protest organized by MU students Alana Hayes and
   MarKeia "Nova" Kellogg was held in Speakers Circle to urge MU to
   formally condemn white supremacy and to take preventative measures
   against racialdiscrimination on campus.

   The MU administration did not issue any statements condemning white
   supremacy or the posters as demanded by protestors.

   "This isn't one and done - there's work that needs to be done on this
   campus," Walker said.

   Walker believes combined momentum from recent protests and the outrage
   from Miller's post can aid in creating a positive change on campus, but
   knows momentum alone isn't enough. Walker said MU needs to focus on
   diversifying its faculty and executive board. According to data from MU
   Analytics, as of 2021, 4.13% of tenured MU faculty were identified
   Black.

   "A lot of people don't feel the comfort that they need to go to faculty
   or staff about these situations, because a lot of times they don't have
   a Black professor, or a Black dean, or a Black ambassador, or
   anything," Walker said.

   Calls for a more diverse faculty were present in Mizzou Fails'
   upper-tier demands as well as the demands issued in 2015 by Concerned
   Student 1950, a student organization formed in 2015 after a string of
   racist incidents on MU's campus. CS1950's [45]demands called for a
   series of administrative efforts aimed toward a more equitable campus
   -- [46]most notably the removal of then-UM System President [47]Tim
   Wolfe.

   The demands were delivered in tandem with [48]protests, including a
   hunger strike by MU student Jonathan Butler, a refusal to play by MU's
   football team, and mass sit-ins and boycotts by students.

   CS1950 founding member Maxwell Little believes few strides have been
   made following the 2015 efforts.

   "It depends on how you measure change and how you look at what's
   changed," Little said. "From a structural and institutional perspective
   -- no, there hasn't been change when you look at the list of demands
   that [CS1950] had."

   According to Little, Miller's action reflects poorly on the
   university's progress.

   "Hate speech impacts not just the students but the campus as a whole,"
   Little said. "MU has been trying to rebuild its brand since 2015.  So
   if they are in the rebuilding of the brand, they should take immediate
   action to make sure nothing like this continues to happen."

   As the committee reviews Miller's case, many are calling for MU to take
   actionable steps to prevent future incidents. Students hope to see
   Miller's immediate removal from leadership in MU's Students for Life
   following her resignation from MU's Turning Point USA.

   "Forcing her to step down from leadership positions would send a
   message to other racists on campus ... it would show them that their
   actions have consequences," Jordan said.

   Additionally, many feel that expulsion from MU is necessary.

   "[Expulsion] is a very serious thing, but when she's making a comment
   about African Americans, I really do think that is a very serious
   action that needs a very serious consequence," Walker said.

   In addition to consequences for Miller, Walker said she wants to see
   intentionality and transparency within the MU administration.

   "I feel like more than anything, just a personal email, that's not
   auto-generated and is coming from a person who's actively investigating
   this case, would be really helpful to know exactly how the institution
   is handling this situation," Walker said. "So we know they're not
   putting it aside and just saying they're investigating the case."

   As the investigation continues, Walker hopes Miller's case committee
   takes the proper steps to address and prevent acts of racism at MU.
   She asks, "What are you doing to actively combat racism, prejudice, and
   microaggression on this campus, not just when there are specific
   instances, but every single day? Where do your priorities lie when it
   comes to racism and prejudice on this campus?"

Airbnb finds people have more trouble booking stays if hosts think they are
Black

   Airbnb CEO releases pictures of bedroom in his home for rent

   New York CNN  --

   Airbnb on Tuesday said it has found a "meaningful difference" in the
   booking success rate for users who are perceived to be White compared
   to those who are perceived to be Black. The findings come after the
   company launched an initiative to uncover and remedy race-based
   discrimination on its platform.

   While all users successfully had their reservations confirmed by hosts
   more than 90% of the time in 2021, Airbnb said it found a notable gap
   in user experiences during that time depending on their apparent racial
   identity. Users who were perceived to be White had a booking success
   rate of 94.1% while users who were thought to be Black had a success
   rate of 91.4%, according to the company. (Those perceived as Asian and
   Latino/Hispanic had booking success rates sitting in between.)

   "It is a meaningful difference, and it's unacceptable,"Janaye Ingram,
   Airbnb's director of community partner programs and engagement, told
   CNN. "It is something that we obviously are not okay with and we are
   doing a lot to address."

   The findings are part of Project Lighthouse, an effort launched by
   Airbnb in 2020 to collect data on racial discrepancies on its service.
   The project was developed in partnership with Color of Change, the
   nation's largest online racial justice organization, and with the
   support of other national privacy and civil rights organizations like
   the NAACP and Asian Americans Advancing Justice.

   Airbnb's efforts to address racial disparity on its platform come after
   the company repeatedly [142]faced scrutiny on the issue. A 2015
   [143]study from Harvard found that Airbnb hosts were less likely to
   rent to guests with names that sounded African American. The next year,
   Airbnb [144]was hit with a lawsuit accusing it of discriminatory
   housing practices. (A federal judge later [145]blocked the suit.) And
   in 2019, the company [146]settled a lawsuit from several Black women in
   Oregon alleging customers were discriminated against based on their
   race.

   The company said Tuesday that information collected through the Project
   Lighthouse initiative is being used to inform the company's approach to
   bookings and reviews in an effort to minimize racialdiscrimination for
   prospective guests.

   "You can't fix what you don't measure," Ingram said.

   Airbnb has taken a number of steps in recent years to address concerns
   about racial disparities on its platform, including getting rid of
   guests' profile pictures prior to booking, making more people eligible
   for the "Instant Book" feature that bypasses host approval, auditing
   booking rejections and making it easier for all guests to receive
   reviews, according to the company.

   On Tuesday, Airbnb said Project Lighthouse revealed another potential
   issue in need of tweaking: guests with more reviews have higher booking
   success rates than those without, and guests perceived to be White or
   Asian have more reviews than others. In response, Airbnb plans to make
   it easier for all guests to receive a review when they travel, an
   effort that it hopes will have a large impact on the Black and Latino
   or Hispanic communities.

   The findings released on Tuesday come after Airbnb conducted two racial
   audits in 2016 and 2019.

   "Racial audits work, as long as corporations make the changes necessary
   to address what they expose," said Rashad Robinson, president of Color
   Of Change. "Six years after Airbnb's first racial audit, and two years
   after Color Of Change negotiated Project Lighthouse, Airbnb is now a
   leading example of what it looks like to back up the rhetoric of racial
   justice with the policy, practice and personnel that can prevent
   rampant racialdiscrimination."

Fact Sheet: U.S. Efforts to Combat Systemic Racism

    1. [64]Home
    2. [65]Briefing Room
    3. [66]Statements and Releases

   "The prevalence, and pervasiveness, of racialdiscrimination might make
   the situation look hopeless, but we remain hopeful. Let us expose the
   racism and racialdiscrimination endemic to every society, around the
   globe. Let us press forward, to root out that discrimination and remove
   the rot from our foundations. And on this day dedicated to ending
   racialdiscrimination, let us leave our children a less hateful, more
   hopeful world."

   -- U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations, Linda Thomas-Greenfield

   Combating systemic racism requires aggressive action to address
   structures, policies, and practices that contribute to the wealth gap,
   to health disparities, and to inequalities in educational access,
   outcomes, and beyond. Today, on the occasion of the United Nations'
   (UN) International Day for the Elimination of racialdiscrimination,
   the United States reiterates its determination to address these
   challenges at home and abroad, and to make clear to the world that
   nations with genuine devotion to human rights and equality do not
   conceal their own failings - they confront them honestly,
   transparently, and with a determination to make things right.

   Here is what the administration is doing to address systemic racism:

   Advancing Racial Equity in the Federal Government: On Day 1 of this
   administration, the President issued Executive Order (EO) 13985 which
   established that the Federal Government should pursue a comprehensive
   approach to advancing equity for all and creating opportunities for the
   improvement of communities that have been historically underserved.

   Condemning and Combating Racism, Xenophobia, and Intolerance Against
   the Asian American and Pacific Islander (AAPI) Community: On January
   26, President Biden issued a Memorandum Condemning and Combating
   Racism, Xenophobia, and Intolerance against Asian Americans and Pacific
   Islanders in the United States. The memorandum orders executive
   departments and agencies to take all appropriate steps to ensure that
   official actions, documents, and statements, including those that
   pertain to the COVID-19 pandemic, do not exhibit or contribute to
   racism, xenophobia, and intolerance against Asian Americans and Pacific
   Islanders.

   Assessing Domestic Violent Extremism: President Biden directed the U.S.
   government interagency to study the threat of domestic violent
   extremism in the United States. Earlier this week, the Office of the
   Director of National Intelligence released the unclassified executive
   summary of the comprehensive assessment acknowledging that domestic
   violent extremist motivations include biases against minority
   populations.

   Creating a Chief Diversity and Inclusion Officer (CDIO) at the State
   Department: Secretary of State Blinken created the position of a Chief
   Diversity and Inclusion Officer (CDIO) at the State Department, in
   recognition of the crucial role diversity, equity, and inclusion can
   and should play in U.S. foreign policy. Reporting directly to the
   Secretary, the CDIO will align and advance Diversity and Inclusion
   policies across the department, bring transparency to these
   initiatives, and hold senior leadership accountable on progress.

   Incorporating Racial Justice into U.S. Foreign Policy Goals: Addressing
   systemic racism andstrengthening democracy in the United States is a
   critical part ofPresident Biden'sforeign policy vision. The Secretary
   of State shall submit a report to the appropriate congressional
   committees describing initiatives that address racial and ethnic
   discrimination abroad, to include a list of Department efforts that
   explicitly focus on addressing racial and ethnic prejudice and
   discriminations, funding for civil society grants and Embassy programs
   and initiatives, exchange and leadership programs, and related efforts.
   This includes State Department programming through the Bureau of
   Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor (DRL) and the U.S. Agency for
   International Development (USAID).

   Supporting Historically Marginalized Populations Around the World:
   Globally, the United States supports organizations to empower racial
   and ethnic minority communities, and uphold the dignity of people who
   are systematically denied their human rights and fundamental freedoms.
   Programs support locally-led efforts to combat all types of racial and
   ethnic hatred and violence and facilitate access to justice for victims
   of racism. Initiatives are intersectional and support individuals who
   face discrimination on account of gender identity and expression,
   sexual orientation, disability, race or ethnicity, religion, and
   national origin.

   Calling for Action at the UN Human Rights Council: At the UN Human
   Rights Council, more than 140 nations joined the United States in a
   statement outlining the continuing scourge of racism and racial
   discrimination, xenophobia, and other forms of intolerance. This
   historic cross-regional statement is a call to action for all nations
   to:
     * acknowledge and address the legacy and persistence of systemic
       racism
     * review and revise long-standing practices and policies to ensure
       all individuals are treated equally
     * embed fairness and inclusivity in decision-making processes
     * redress inequities in policies that serve as barriers to equal
       opportunity
     * eliminate barriers to political participation

   Nominating a U.S. Representative to the Committee on the Elimination of
   racialdiscrimination: The United States nominated Professor Gay
   McDougall to serve on the Committee on the Elimination of Racial
   Discrimination, a body of 18 independent experts that monitors
   implementation of the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of
   racialdiscrimination by its State parties. Her nomination underscores
   the value that the Biden administration places on the Committee's work.

Overview

   The United States criminal justice system is the largest in the world.
   At yearend 2015, over 6.7 million individuals[60]^1 were under some
   form of correctional control in the United States, including 2.2
   million incarcerated in federal, state, or local prisons and
   jails.[61]^2 The U.S. is a world leader in its rate of incarceration,
   dwarfing the rate of nearly every other nation.[62]^3

   Such broad statistics mask the racial disparity that pervades the U.S.
   criminal justice system, and for African Americans in particular.
   African Americans are more likely than white Americans to be arrested;
   once arrested, they are more likely to be convicted; and once
   convicted, and they are more likely to experience lengthy prison
   sentences. African-American adults are 5.9 times as likely to be
   incarcerated than whites and Hispanics are 3.1 times as likely.[63]^4
   As of 2001, one of every three black boys born in that year could
   expect to go to prison in his lifetime, as could one of every six
   Latinos--compared to one of every seventeen white boys.[64]^5 Racial
   and ethnic disparities among women are less substantial than among men
   but remain prevalent.[65]^6

   The source of such disparities is deeper and more systemic than
   explicit racialdiscrimination. The United States in effect operates
   two distinct criminal justice systems: one for wealthy people and
   another for poor people and people of color. The wealthy can access a
   vigorous adversary system replete with constitutional protections for
   defendants. Yet the experiences of poor and minority defendants within
   the criminal justice system often differ substantially from that model
   due to a number of factors, each of which contributes to the
   overrepresentation of such individuals in the system. As former
   Georgetown Law Professor David Cole states in his book No Equal
   Justice,

   These double standards are not, of course, explicit; on the face of it,
   the criminal law is color-blind and class-blind. But in a sense, this
   only makes the problem worse. The rhetoric of the criminal justice
   system sends the message that our society carefully protects everyone's
   constitutional rights, but in practice the rules assure that law
   enforcement prerogatives will generally prevail over the rights of
   minorities and the poor. By affording criminal suspects substantial
   constitutional rights in theory, the Supreme Court validates the
   results of the criminal justice system as fair. That formal fairness
   obscures the systemic concerns that ought to be raised by the fact that
   the prison population is overwhelmingly poor and disproportionately
   black.[66]^7

   By creating and perpetuating policies that allow such racial
   disparities to exist in its criminal justice system, the United States
   is in violation of its obligations under Article 2 and Article 26 of
   the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights to ensure that
   all its residents--regardless of race--are treated equally under the
   law. The Sentencing Project notes that the United Nations Special
   Rapporteur is working to consult with U.S. civil society organizations
   on contemporary forms of racism, racialdiscrimination, and related
   intolerance. We welcome this opportunity to provide the UN Special
   Rapporteur with an accurate assessment of racial disparity in the U.S.
   criminal justice system.

   Established in 1986, The Sentencing Project works for a fair and
   effective U.S. criminal justice system by promoting reforms in
   sentencing policy, addressing unjust racial disparities and practices,
   and advocating for alternatives to incarceration. Staff of The
   Sentencing Project have testified before the U.S. Congress and state
   legislative bodies and have submitted amicus curiae briefs to the
   Supreme Court of the United States on various issues related to
   incarceration and criminal justice policy. The organization's research
   findings are regularly relied upon by policymakers and covered by major
   news outlets.

   This report chronicles the racial disparity that permeates every stage
   of the United States criminal justice system, from arrest to trial to
   sentencing to post prison experiences. In particular, the report
   highlights research findings that address rates of racial disparity and
   their underlying causes throughout the criminal justice system. The
   report concludes by offering recommendations on ways that federal,
   state, and local officials in the United States can work to eliminate
   racial disparity in the criminal justice system and uphold its
   obligations under the Covenant.

Racial Disparity in the United States Criminal Justice System

A. Policing

   In 2016, black Americans comprised 27% of all individuals arrested in
   the United States--double their share of the total population.[67]^8
   Black youth accounted for 15% of all U.S. children yet made up 35% of
   juvenile arrests in that year.[68]^9 What might appear at first to be a
   linkage between race and crime is in large part a function of
   concentrated urban poverty, which is far more common for African
   Americans than for other racial groups. This accounts for a substantial
   portion of African Americans' increased likelihood of committing
   certain violent and property crimes.[69]^10 But while there is a higher
   black rate of involvement in certain crimes, white Americans
   overestimate the proportion of crime committed by blacks and Latinos,
   overlook the fact that communities of color are disproportionately
   victims of crime, and discount the prevalence of bias in the criminal
   justice system.[70]^11

   In 1968, the Kerner Commission called on the country to make "massive
   and sustained" investments in jobs and education to reverse the
   "segregation and poverty [that] have created in the racial ghetto a
   destructive environment totally unknown to most white
   Americans."[71]^12 Fifty years later, the Commission's lone surviving
   member concluded that "in many ways, things have gotten no better--or
   have gotten worse."[72]^13

   The rise of mass incarceration begins with disproportionate levels of
   police contact with African Americans. This is striking in particular
   for drug offenses, which are committed at roughly equal rates across
   races. "One reason minorities are stopped disproportionately is because
   police see violations where they are," said Louis Dekmar, the president
   of the International Association of Chiefs of Police, and chief of
   LaGrange, Georgia's police department.[73]^14 The chief added: "Crime
   is often significantly higher in minority neighborhoods than elsewhere.
   And that is where we allocate our resources." Dekmar's view is not
   uncommon. Absent meaningful efforts to address societal segregation and
   disproportionate levels of poverty, U.S. criminal justice policies have
   cast a dragnet targeting African Americans. The War on Drugs as well as
   policing policies including "Broken Windows" and "Stop, Question, and
   Frisk" sanction higher levels of police contact with African Americans.
   This includes higher levels of police contact with innocent people and
   higher levels of arrests for drug crimes. Thus:
     * More than one in four people arrested for drug law violations in
       2015 was black, although drug use rates do not differ substantially
       by race and ethnicity and drug users generally purchase drugs from
       people of the same race or ethnicity.[74]^15 For example, the ACLU
       found that blacks were 3.7 times more likely to be arrested for
       marijuana possession than whites in 2010, even though their rate of
       marijuana usage was comparable.[75]^16
     * The highest officials in New York City had "turned a blind eye to
       the evidence that officers are conducting stops in a racially
       discriminatory manner," Judge Shira A. Scheindlin concluded
       regarding the city's stop-and-frisk tactic, declaring it
       unconstitutional in 2013.[76]^17 The policy, which broadly targeted
       male residents of neighborhoods populated by low-income people of
       color to uncover drugs and weapons, was shown to be ineffective,
       and this assessment was further validated when New York City
       continued its crime decline after scaling back Stop and Frisk. Yet
       other localities continue to deploy the practice.[77]^18
     * New York City, like many other cities, remains reluctant to scale
       back Broken Windows Policing, a public safety approach that relies
       on clamping down on petty offenses and neighborhood disorder.
       Between 2001 and 2013, 51% of the city's population over age 16 was
       black or Hispanic. Yet during that period, 82% of those arrested
       for misdemeanors were black or Hispanic, as were 81% of those who
       received summonses for violations of the administrative code
       (including such behaviors as public consumption of alcohol,
       disorderly conduct, and bicycling on the sidewalk.).[78]^19 Yet
       research shows that order-maintenance strategies have had only a
       modest impact on serious crime rates and have caused great damage
       to communities of color.[79]^20 These strategies also expose people
       of color to a greater risk of being killed during a police
       encounter.

   In addition to pursuing policies that bring little gain in crime
   reduction and impose great costs on people of color, policymakers and
   criminal justice leaders have been late to address discriminatory
   policies for which they provide no justification--such as biased use of
   officer discretion and revenue-driven policing. Thus:
     * In recent years, black drivers have been somewhat more likely to be
       stopped than whites but have been far more likely to be searched
       and arrested.[80]^21 The causes and outcomes of these stops differ
       by race, and staggering racial disparities in rates of police stops
       persist in certain jurisdictions--pointing to unchecked racial
       bias, whether intentional or not, in officer discretion. A closer
       look at the causes of traffic stops reveals that police are more
       likely to stop black and Hispanic drivers for discretionary
       reasons--for "investigatory stops" (proactive stops used to
       investigate drivers deemed suspicious) rather than "traffic-safety
       stops" (reactive stops used to enforce traffic laws or vehicle
       codes).[81]^22 Nationwide surveys also reveal disparities in the
       outcomes of police stops. Once pulled over, black and Hispanic
       drivers were three times as likely as whites to be searched (6% and
       7% versus 2%) and blacks were twice as likely as whites to be
       arrested.[82]^23 These patterns hold even though police officers
       generally have a lower "contraband hit rate" when they search black
       versus white drivers.[83]^24
     * "Ferguson's law enforcement practices are shaped by the City's
       focus on revenue rather than by public safety needs," the Civil
       Rights Division of the Department of Justice (DOJ) concluded in
       2015, after the police killing of Michael Brown brought national
       attention to police-community tensions in the St. Louis, Missouri
       suburb.[84]^25 The DOJ found that black residents' disproportionate
       rate of police stops, searches, and arrests resulted from city
       officials' growing reliance on municipal fines and fees which
       police officers and court officers were exhorted to deliver through
       aggressive enforcement of traffic violations and petty offenses.
       ArchCity Defenders, authors of an early and influential white paper
       on the troubled municipal court system, has demonstrated that many
       other St. Louis municipalities have similar or worse practices than
       Ferguson.[85]^26

B. Pretrial

   African Americans were incarcerated in local jails at a rate 3.5 times
   that of non-Hispanic whites in 2016.[86]^27 These disparities stem in
   part from the policies and practices of policing described earlier, but
   are compounded by those introduced at this stage of processing. Given
   that nearly two-thirds (65%) of people in jail in 2016 were being
   detained prior to trial, policies and decisions influencing pretrial
   detention play a key role in driving the disparity in the jail
   population and beyond.[87]^27

   Pretrial detention has been shown to increase the odds of conviction,
   and people who are detained awaiting trial are also more likely to
   accept less favorable plea deals, to be sentenced to prison, and to
   receive longer sentences. Seventy percent of pretrial releases require
   money bond, an especially high hurdle for low-income defendants, who
   are disproportionately people of color.[88]^29 Blacks and Latinos are
   more likely than whites to be denied bail, to have a higher money bond
   set, and to be detained because they cannot pay their bond.[89]^29 They
   are often assessed to be higher safety and flight risks because they
   are more likely to experience socioeconomic disadvantage and to have
   criminal records. Implicit bias also contributes to people of color
   faring worse than comparable whites in bail determinations.

C. Sentencing

   Although African Americans and Latinos comprise 29% of the U.S.
   population, they make up 57% of the U.S. prison population.[90]^31 This
   results in imprisonment rates for African-American and Hispanic adults
   that are 5.9 and 3.1 times the rate for white adults, respectively--and
   at far higher levels in some states.[91]^32 Notably, these disparities
   exist for both the least and most serious offenses:
     * Of the 277,000 people imprisoned nationwide for a drug offense,
       over half (56%) are African American or Latino.[92]^33
     * Nearly half (48%) of the 206,000 people serving life and "virtual
       life" prison sentences are African American and another 15% are
       Latino.[93]^34

   Among youth, African Americans are 4.1 times as likely to be committed
   to secure placements as whites, American Indians are 3.1 times as
   likely, and Hispanics are 1.5 times as likely.[94]^35 Although levels
   of youth confinement have significantly declined in recent years, the
   racial gap between black and American Indian versus white youth has
   increased.[95]^36

   The racial disparities in the adult and juvenile justice systems stem
   in part from the policing and pretrial factors described earlier, and
   are compounded by discretionary decisions and sentencing policies that
   disadvantage people of color because of their race or higher rates of
   socioeconomic disadvantage.[96]^20 These include:
     * Biased use of discretion: Prosecutors are more likely to charge
       people of color with crimes that carry heavier sentences than
       whites. Federal prosecutors, for example, are twice as likely to
       charge African Americans with offenses that carry a mandatory
       minimum sentence than similarly situated whites.[97]^38 State
       prosecutors are also more likely to charge black rather than
       similar white defendants under habitual offender laws.[98]^39
     * Policies that disadvantage people of color: Drug-free school zone
       laws mandate sentencing enhancements for people caught selling
       drugs in designated school zones. The expansive geographic range of
       these zones coupled with high urban density has disproportionately
       affected residents of urban areas, and particularly those in
       high-poverty areas - who are largely people of color.[99]^40
       Legislators in New Jersey scaled back their state law after a study
       found that 96% of persons subject to these enhancements were
       African American or Latino. All 50 states and the District of
       Columbia have some form of drug-free school zone law.
     * Policies that disadvantage poor people: Most jurisdictions
       inadequately fund their indigent defense programs. While there are
       many high-quality public defender offices, in far too many cases
       indigent individuals are represented by public defenders with
       excessively high caseloads, or by assigned counsel with limited
       experience in criminal defense. Public defenders in Louisiana have
       recently sued the state and those in Kansas City, Missouri have
       protested their crushing caseloads.[100]^41

D. Parole

   During the era of mass incarceration, a declining proportion of the
   prison population has a sentence that allows for discretionary release
   on parole, as lawmakers have required courts to shift from
   indeterminate sentences (whose release requires a discretionary parole
   decision) to fixed-term sentences (which have set release
   dates).[101]^42 Among sentences that allow for discretionary parole
   release, the process can be harder for people of color. Some research
   suggests that parole boards are influenced by an applicant's race in
   their decision making, though more research is needed in this
   area.[102]^43 Racial bias among correctional officers also shapes
   parole outcomes. As revealed by a New York Times investigation on New
   York prisons, comparable in-prison conduct--a major determinant of
   parole decisions--may result in divergent prison disciplinary records
   for blacks and Latinos versus whites.[103]^44 Based on an analysis of
   almost 60,000 disciplinary cases from the state's prisons, reporters
   found that disparities in discipline were greatest for infractions that
   gave discretion to guards, such as disobeying a direct order.

   Underinvestment and racial disparities also persist in community
   supervision--with many parole and probation systems offering
   supervision with little support, and with evidence that parole and
   probation officers are more likely to revoke people of color than
   whites for comparable behavior. For example, the Urban Institute's
   examination of probation revocation rates in Dallas County, Texas;
   Iowa's Sixth Judicial District; Multnomah County, Oregon; and New York
   City revealed that black probationers were revoked at disproportionate
   rates in all study sites at levels which "raise concerns about the
   presence of bias to the disadvantage of black probationers."

E. Post Prison/Collateral Consequences

   African Americans--particularly black men--are most exposed to the
   collateral consequences associated with a criminal record. In 2010, 8%
   of all adults in the United States had a felony conviction on their
   record.[104]^45 Among African-American men, the rate was one in three
   (33%).[105]^45 People with criminal records face a host of obstacles to
   re-enter society even after they have fully completed their term of
   incarceration or community supervision. These include barriers to
   securing steady employment and housing, to accessing the social safety
   net and federal student aid, and to exercising the right to vote.

   Nearly one-third of U.S. workers hold jobs that require an occupational
   license, a requirement which sometimes bars and often poses cumbersome
   obstacles for people with criminal records.[106]^47 In sectors that do
   not require licensing, employers are 50% less likely to call back white
   job applicants with incarceration histories than comparable applicants
   without prison records.[107]^48 African American job applicants, who
   are less likely to receive callbacks than whites to begin with,
   experience an even more pronounced discrimination related to a criminal
   record. As scholar Devah Pager's research has revealed, whites with
   criminal records receive more favorable treatment than blacks without
   criminal records.[108]^48 People with criminal convictions also face
   discrimination in the private rental market and those with felony drug
   convictions face restrictions in accessing government-assisted
   housing.[109]^50

   The Welfare Reform Act of 1996 imposed a lifetime denial of cash
   assistance and food stamps to people convicted in state or federal
   courts of felony drug offenses, unless states opt out of the
   ban.[110]^51 Given the dynamics of social class and the accompanying
   disparate racial effects of the criminal justice system, women and
   children of color are disproportionately impacted by this exclusionary
   law.[111]^51 By 2018, 24 states had fully opted out of the food stamp
   ban, 21 others had only done so in part, and five states continued to
   fully enforce the ban.[112]^53 An even larger number of states continue
   to impose a partial or full ban on cash assistance for people with
   felony drug convictions.[113]^53

   Disenfranchisement patterns have also reflected the dramatic growth and
   disproportionate impact of criminal convictions. A record 6.1 million
   Americans were forbidden from voting because of their felony record in
   2016, rising from 1.2 million in 1976.[114]^55 Felony
   disenfranchisement rates for voting-age African Americans reached 7.4%
   in 2016--four times the rate of non-African Americans (1.8%).[115]^55
   In three states, more than one in five voting-age African Americans is
   disenfranchised: Florida, Kentucky, and Tennessee.[116]^57 The majority
   of disenfranchised Americans are living in their communities, having
   fully completed their sentences or remaining supervised while on
   probation or parole.

Recommendations to the UN Special Rapporteur

   As the research presented in this report indicates, the causes of the
   racial disparities in the U.S. criminal justice system are complex and
   deeply rooted. As studies repeatedly demonstrate, the cumulative impact
   of racial disparity is experienced throughout the country's criminal
   justice system. Beliefs that the current system is unaffected by
   centuries of an explicitly racist past is wishful thinking and
   potentially blinds decision makers to the implicit racial bias that
   orients the American consciousness and is embedded in its formal
   policies.

   The United States can adopt concrete measures to reduce both the
   existence and the effects of racial bias in its criminal justice
   system. As such, The Sentencing Project respectfully urges the UN
   Special Rapporteur to recommend that the United States adopt the
   following recommendations.

End the War on Drugs.

   The United States should substantially end its War on Drugs.
   Specifically, the Department of Justice should reconsider and reduce
   the volume of low-level drug offenders prosecuted in federal court.
   State officials can also adopt law changes to divert prison-bound
   defendants into effective alternatives to incarceration programs. Local
   police departments should significantly scale back drug arrests. The
   resources saved by decreasing the number of prosecutions should be
   invested in evidence-based drug prevention and treatment measures.

Eliminate mandatory minimum sentences.

   The United States should eliminate mandatory minimum sentences. Judges
   should be allowed to consider individual case characteristics when
   sentencing a defendant in every case. Mandatory sentences do not
   eliminate discretion in the courtroom--they simply shift it from judges
   to prosecutors, thereby reducing transparency in decision making.

Reduce the Use of Cash Bail.

   Defendants should be detained pretrial only if they pose a safety or
   flight risk, not because they cannot afford to post bail. A well
   calibrated and transparent risk-assessment instrument can be used to
   determine who should be released on their own recognizance, who should
   be released with some requirements, and who should be detained.

Fully fund indigent defense agencies.

   The United States should fully fund and staff indigent defense agencies
   through an appropriate mix of local, state, and federal resources. The
   federal government should increase support for training and technical
   assistance for indigent defense, and document shortcomings of
   jurisdictions that fail to meet established bar association standards
   for caseloads and professional training.

Adopt a policy requiring the use of racial impact statements.

   Policies should be adopted at the federal and state levels requiring
   the use of racial impact statements for proposed sentencing policies.
   Such a policy would require legislators to prepare an analysis
   assessing the possible disparate racial consequences of any proposed
   legislation before enacting it in order to avoid any unintended
   disparate racial effects.[117]^58 Four states--Iowa, Connecticut,
   Oregon, and New Jersey--have adopted racial impact statement
   requirements since 2008.

Develop and implement training to reduce racial bias.

   The United States should develop and implement training designed to
   mitigate the influence of implicit racial bias at every level of the
   criminal justice system: police officers, public defenders,
   prosecutors, judges, jury members, and parole boards. While it is
   difficult to eliminate completely racial bias at the individual level,
   studies have repeatedly shown that it is possible to control for the
   effects of implicit racial bias on individual decision-making.[118]^59
   In other words, while it may be impossible in the current culture of
   the United States to ensure that individuals are cognitively
   colorblind, it is possible to train individuals to be behaviorally
   colorblind.[119]^60 The United States should work with leading scholars
   on implicit bias to develop the most effective training programs, and
   couple this with systems of monitoring and accountability to reduce the
   influence of implicit racial bias.

Address Collateral Consequences.

   Denying the right to vote to an entire class of citizens is deeply
   problematic to a democratic society and counterproductive to effective
   reentry. The federal government should allow Americans to vote
   regardless of their conviction status, and certainly after they have
   concluded their sentences. States should also allow the full democratic
   participation of their citizens. Government officials should also
   revise policies that serve no public safety function but impose
   collateral consequences on people with criminal convictions--such as in
   the realms of employment, education, housing, and in the social safety
   net--and encourage similar reforms in the private sector.

Conclusion

   For decades, the United States of America has employed mass
   incarceration as a convenient answer to inconvenient questions. These
   policies have produced dramatic rates of incarceration, with a
   particularly disproportionate impact on communities of color. In
   addition to the range of harmful consequences to people of color, mass
   incarceration has been a failed policy in regard to public safety
   outcomes. Research has documented that the effect of imprisonment on
   crime rates has been modest, and that at current levels the scale of
   incarceration is well past the point of diminishing returns for public
   safety. Mass incarceration has diverted resources from prevention and
   treatment initiatives that could have produced far more effective
   approaches to crime reduction.

   In recent years, the U.S. government has addressed some of the glaring
   racial inequalities that permeate every aspect of its criminal justice
   system, but these efforts have been relatively modest in scope. The
   government continues to both foster and perpetuate inequalities in
   clear violation of its obligations under the International Covenant on
   Civil and Political Rights as well as other international agreements.

   The proliferation of racial disparities in the U.S. criminal justice
   system has a profound impact on the lives of people of color. Behind
   each statistic lies the face of a young black man or woman whose
   potential has been cut short by a harsh prison sentence mandated by
   draconian drug laws. Behind each percentage point lies the face of a
   Latina child who will only know her parents through hurried, awkward
   visits in a prison visitation room. Behind each dataset lies a
   community of color bereft of hope because its young people have been
   locked away.

   It is the human face--a face of color--of the racial injustice of the
   United States criminal justice system that is the most compelling
   reason for reform. It is time for the United States to take affirmative
   steps to eliminate the racial disparities in its criminal justice
   system.

Little progress combating systemic racism against people of African descent:
UN report

   30 September 2022 [69]Human Rights

   More than two years since the murder of George Floyd by a police
   officer in the United States sparked the global Black Lives Matter
   movement, there's been only "piecemeal progress" in addressing systemic
   racism, the UN human rights office (OHCHR) said on Friday, in a new
   report.

   While more people have been made aware of systemic racism and concrete
   steps have been taken in some countries, the Acting High Commissioner
   for Human Rights called on States to demonstrate greater political will
   to accelerate action.

   Systemic racism against people of #AfricanDescent continues to inflict
   deep harm. Piecemeal progress is not enough. New @UN report calls for
   transformative change to dismantle deep-rooted systems perpetuating
   racialdiscrimination: [70]https://t.co/K5Oi150TTn

   #FightRacism [71]https://t.co/cEgNEZtAz9
   UN Human Rights
   UNHumanRights
   September 30, 2022

   "There have been some initiatives in different countries to address
   racism, but for the most part they are piecemeal. They fall short of
   the comprehensive evidence-based approaches needed to dismantle the
   entrenched structural, institutional and societal racism that has
   existed for centuries, and continues to inflict deep harm today," said
   Nada Al-Nashif, who will present the report to the UN [72]Human Rights
   Council on Monday.

   She specifically pointed to key recommendations made in
   [73]OHCHR's [74]Agenda towards Transformative Change for Racial Justice
   and Equality.

Triggering change

   The report describes international, national and local initiatives that
   have been taken, towards ending the scourge of racism.

   These include an Executive Order from the White House on advancing
   effective, accountable policing and criminal justice practices in
   federal law enforcement agencies; an Anti-Racism Data Act in British
   Columbia, Canada; measures to evaluate ethnic profiling by police in
   Sweden; and census data collection to self-identify people of African
   descent in Argentina.

   The European Commission has issued guidance on collecting and using
   data based on racial or ethnic origin; formal apologies issued,
   memorialization, revisiting public spaces, and research, to assess
   links to enslavement and colonialism in several countries.

`Barometer for success'

   The report notes that poor outcomes continue for people of African
   descent in many countries, notably in accessing health and adequate
   food, education, social protection, and justice - while poverty,
   enforced disappearance and violence continues.

   It highlights "continuing...allegations of discriminatory treatment,
   unlawful deportations, excessive use of force, and deaths of African
   migrants and migrants of African descent by law enforcement officials"

   "The barometer for success must be positive change in the lived
   experiences of people of African descent," continued Ms. Al-Nashif.

   "States need to listen to people of African descent, meaningfully
   involve them and take genuine steps to act upon their concerns."

   Tennessee, during the Civil Rights Movement in the USA.

Higher death rates

   Where available, recent data still points to disproportionately high
   death rates faced by people of African descent, at the hands of law
   enforcement, in different countries.

   "Families of African descent continued to report the immense
   challenges, barriers and protracted processes they faced in their
   pursuit of truth and justice for the deaths of their relatives", the
   report says.

   It details seven cases of police-related deaths of people of African
   descent, namely George Floyd and Breonna Taylor (US); Adama Traor?
   (France); Luana Barbosa dos Reis Santos and Jo?o Pedro Matos Pinto
   (Brazil); Kevin Clarke (UK) and Janner [Hanner] Garc?a Palomino
   (Colombia).

   While noting some progress towards accountability in a few of these
   emblematic cases, "unfortunately, not a single case has yet been
   brought to a full conclusion, with those families still seeking truth,
   justice and guarantees of non-repetition, and the prosecution and
   sanction of all those responsible," the report says.

   Ms. Al-Nashif called on States to "redouble efforts to ensure
   accountability and redress wherever deaths of Africans and people of
   African descent have occurred in the context of law enforcement, and
   take measures to confront legacies that perpetuate and sustain systemic
   racism".

   U.S. Statement at Debate on racialdiscrimination

   By [212]U.S. Mission Geneva

   Debate on racialdiscrimination
   Midterm review of the International Decade for People of African
   Descent

   46th Session of the Human Rights Council
   March 12, 2021

   As Delivered by Charles Bentley

   Panelists, thank you for your presentations on this important issue.

   All across the world, including in the United States, we see young
   people raise their voices against the destructive legacy of racism.
   They have recognized that lack of access to jobs, education,
   healthcare, and opportunity does not happen in a vacuum.  Last summer,
   as protesters of all races, ages, and backgrounds in the United States
   and around the world raised their voices against the-all-too
   frequent occurrence of Black lives ending at the hands of law
   enforcement, we were reminded, yet again, that we must do more
   to address systemic racism.  What many people did not see, or simply
   refused to see, could not be ignored any longer.  The promise
   of "liberty and justice for all" has not been achieved.

   Young people have been at the frontline of this global movement against
   racism and racialdiscrimination.  Now more than ever, we see
   that youth engagement and political participation are vital to
   addressing systemic racism, as well as other global challenges,
   including climate change, the COVID-19 pandemic, and authoritarian
   threats to democracy.  It is essential that we commit to giving young
   people access to the political space and providing an enabling
   environment for them to be active citizens.

   In his first weeks in office, President Biden established a
   whole-of-government process to assess and end systemic racism in
   government policy, programs, and institutions.  He signed executive
   actions to redress racially discriminatory federal housing policies and
   end the federal government's use of private prisons, a first step
   towards addressing mass incarceration, which disproportionately
   impacts people of African descent and other people of color.  He also
   extended a pause on repaying student loans during the pandemic, which
   represent a disproportionate economic burden for people of color.
   These actions support young Americans, who President Biden praised for
   "pulling us toward justice in so many ways."

   As we enter the second half of the International Decade for People of
   African Descent, the United States is committed to empowering and
   listening to youth voices as we work to ensure that equity and the
