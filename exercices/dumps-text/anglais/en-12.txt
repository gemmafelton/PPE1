Abstract

   There is no safe level of exposure to inorganic arsenic or uranium, yet
   recent studies identified sociodemographic and regional inequalities in
   concentrations of these frequently detected contaminants in public
   water systems across the US. We analyze the county-level association
   between racial/ethnic composition and public water arsenic and uranium
   concentrations from 2000-2011 using geospatial models. We find that
   higher proportions of Hispanic/Latino and American Indian/Alaskan
   Native residents are associated with significantly higher arsenic and
   uranium concentrations. These associations differ in magnitude and
   direction across regions; higher proportions of non-Hispanic Black
   residents are associated with higher arsenic and uranium in regions
   where concentrations of these contaminants are high. The findings from
   this nationwide geospatial analysis identifying racial/ethnic
   inequalities in arsenic and uranium concentrations in public drinking
   water across the US can advance environmental justice initiatives by
   informing regulatory action and financial and technical support to
   protect communities of color.

Introduction

   In some US populations, drinking water is a significant source of
   exposure to inorganic arsenic and uranium, which are major
   environmental exposures associated with cancer, cardiovascular disease
   and other adverse health outcomes^[61]1,[62]2,[63]3,[64]4,[65]5,[66]6.
   Inorganic arsenic (a metalloid) is a known human carcinogen, is
   consistently ranked number one on the Centers for Disease Control and
   Prevention (CDC)/Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry's
   (ATSDR) Substance Priority List^[67]7, and is also associated with
   adverse birth outcomes, diabetes, metabolic disease, and cardiovascular
   disease, even at low- to moderate- levels of exposure common in the US
   population^[68]1,[69]3,[70]4,[71]8. While alpha radiation from uranium
   decay is classified as carcinogenic, growing epidemiologic evidence
   also indicates that uranium exposure is associated with chronic kidney
   disease and is toxic to the respiratory, neurologic, and reproductive
   systems^[72]2,[73]6,[74]9,[75]10. The US Environmental Protection
   Agency (EPA) regulates both arsenic and uranium in US public drinking
   water systems, including community water systems (CWSs) which serve
   over 90% of residents year-round^[76]11. Although the US EPA sets a
   maximum contaminant level (MCL) of 30 µg/L for uranium and 10 µg/L for
   arsenic, EPA's non-enforceable maximum contaminant level goal for both
   is 0 µg/L because there is no known safe level of exposure to either
   inorganic arsenic or uranium (Denmark and the states of New Jersey and
   New Hampshire set more health-protective arsenic MCLs of 5 µg/L, and
   drinking water providers in the Netherlands adopted a voluntary
   standard of 1 µg/L in 2016)^[77]12,[78]13,[79]14,[80]15.

   Recent studies indicate that both metals are frequently detected in
   CWSs and significant geographic and sociodemographic inequalities in
   CWS concentrations exist across the US^[81]16,[82]17. CWSs reporting
   the highest concentrations of arsenic and/or uranium were those serving
   communities characterized as Hispanic/Latino or American Indian, those
   located in the Central Midwest or Southwest, those serving incarcerated
   populations in the Southwest, and those reliant on
   groundwater^[83]16,[84]17,[85]18,[86]19. Structural racism likely
   underlies these inequalities in drinking water quality; water
   contaminant exposure disparities are driven by a complex, interactive,
   multilevel system structured around the natural (e.g. hydrogeology,
   climate, soil), built (e.g. agriculture, water infrastructure, land-use
   patterns), and sociopolitical (e.g. regulatory policy, historical
   settlement patterns) environments^[87]20,[88]21,[89]22,[90]23,[91]24.
   These documented disparities in CWS-level arsenic and uranium across
   sociodemographic subgroups underscore the need for robust geospatial
   analyses of community-level racial/ethnic composition and drinking
   water exposures to account for spatial dependency in CWS
   concentrations, which can yield biased effect estimates in traditional
   regression models^[92]25. Previously, nationwide studies evaluating
   these associations were not possible because nationwide estimates of
   contaminant concentrations were not available (distribution boundaries
   are not publicly available for the majority of CWSs). However, our team
   recently developed county-level, population-weighted estimates of
   contaminant concentrations in CWSs across the US for the 2000-2011 time
   period, which were developed from routine compliance monitoring records
   (EPA requires CWSs to routinely monitor for regulated contaminants,
   including arsenic and uranium)^[93]16,[94]17.

   In this study, we examined the county-level association between
   racial/ethnic composition (the proportion of residents belonging to a
   given racial/ethnic group) and CWS arsenic and uranium concentrations
   across the conterminous US using geospatial models. Our objectives were
   to (a) evaluate the county-level distribution and spatial
   autocorrelation of CWS arsenic and uranium, (b) assess the nationwide
   county-level association between racial/ethnic composition and CWS
   arsenic and uranium concentrations in geospatial models, and c)
   quantify the strength, direction, and spatial stationarity of these
   associations at the local level. We specifically assessed geometric
   mean ratios in CWS metal concentrations per 10% higher proportion of
   residents who were non-Hispanic Black, non-Hispanic White,
   Hispanic/Latino, and American Indian/Alaskan Native. We predicted that
   higher proportions of non-Hispanic White residents would be associated
   with lower CWS arsenic and uranium concentrations (likely reflecting
   white supremacy and structural racism related to public drinking water
   infrastructure, investment decisions, and regulatory action that
   specifically benefit non-Hispanic White communities, which have been
   previously documented for some water
   exposures)^[95]23,[96]24,[97]26,[98]27, and that higher proportions of
   Hispanic/Latino and American Indian residents would be associated with
   higher CWS arsenic and uranium concentrations (also consistent with
   previous documented inequalities in public drinking water
   infrastructure and regulatory action across population
   groups)^[99]20,[100]23,[101]28,[102]29. We also anticipated that the
   association between racial/ethnic composition and CWS arsenic and
   uranium concentrations would be unique for each racial/ethnic group and
   would differ in magnitude and direction of the association across
   different regions of the US because of regional differences in
   racial/ethnic composition, geologic context, urban vs rural landscapes,
   and land-use patterns relevant for drinking water arsenic and uranium
   concentrations. As a secondary analysis, we also assessed the
   association between racial/ethnic composition and CWS selenium and
   barium because these metals/metalloids are also regulated in CWSs by
   the EPA, are frequently detected in CWSs, and previous studies found
   significant inequalities in concentrations across sociodemographic and
   regional groups in CWS-level analyses^[103]16 (although the health
   impacts of chronic, low-level exposure to selenium and barium are less
   clear^[104]5,[105]30,[106]31).

   In this work, we show that higher proportions of Hispanic/Latino and
   American Indian/Alaskan Native residents are associated with
   significantly higher CWS arsenic and uranium concentrations at the
   county-level, while higher proportions of non-Hispanic White residents
   are associated with lower CWS arsenic and uranium concentrations. The
   association between racial/ethnic composition and CWS arsenic and
   uranium concentrations differs in magnitude and direction across
   regions; higher proportions of non-Hispanic Black residents is
   associated with higher CWS arsenic and uranium in regions where
   concentrations of these contaminants are high. Findings from this study
   can advance environmental justice initiatives by informing federal and
   state-level infrastructure investments, financial and technical support
   for CWSs, and additional regulatory action to protect communities
   disproportionately exposed to major public drinking water contaminants.

Results

Spatial distribution and clustering of arsenic and uranium in CWSs

   Our analysis uses previously developed, county-level,
   population-weighted concentration estimates of CWS arsenic (2006-2011,
   N = 2585 counties) and uranium (2000-2011, N = 1174
   counties)^[107]16,[108]17. Maps showing the mean concentration
   estimates of county-level CWS arsenic and uranium across the
   conterminous US are presented in Fig. [109]1. Both county-level CWS
   arsenic and uranium exhibited significant positive global spatial
   autocorrelation (Moran's I = 0.62, p value < 0.001 for arsenic, and I =
   0.68, p value < 0.001 for uranium). We next identified specific areas
   of the US where spatial autocorrelation was present by assessing Local
   Indicators of Spatial Association (LISA) clusters. We observed
   significant High-High and Low-Low LISA clusters for both arsenic and
   uranium, which are presented in Fig. [110]1. Areas with High-High
   significant spatial autocorrelation for both arsenic and uranium were
   located in the Midwest and Southwest (e.g. Nevada, California, Arizona,
   New Mexico, Texas, Kansas, Nebraska) where CWS arsenic and uranium
   concentrations are highest in underlying
   groundwater^[111]16,[112]17,[113]32. Low-Low clusters for arsenic were
   identified in the Southeast and Mid-Atlantic regions (e.g. Alabama,
   Arkansas, North and South Carolina, Virginia, Kentucky). Low-Low
   clusters for uranium were located in similar geographic areas, although
   spatial coverage was poorer in the eastern US. We also identified
   significant positive spatial autocorrelation for barium and selenium
   (Supplementary Fig. [114]1).

County-level sociodemographic characteristics and metal concentrations

   Because we restricted our analysis of each racial/ethnic group to
   counties with at least 100 residents of that group to avoid positivity
   violations^[117]33 (i.e., the number of residents in a given
   racial/ethnic subgroup should be greater than zero for all counties
   analyzed or effect estimates would be extrapolated beyond the range of
   actual values), the number of counties included in the analysis of each
   racial/ethnic group differed (see Methods setion: Exclusion criteria).
   Across the counties included in each racial/ethnic analysis and all
   counties included in any analysis (N = 2653), we first described mean
   county-level CWS arsenic and uranium concentrations, racial/ethnic
   composition, and other county-level characteristics of interest
   (Table [118]1). Nationwide, the county-level mean percentage of
   residents belonging to each racial/ethnic group was 7% (non-Hispanic
   Black), 2% (American Indian/Alaskan Native), 9% (Hispanic/Latino), and
   80% (non-Hispanic White). In analyses for each racial/ethnic group, we
   evaluated a total of 1881 (non-Hispanic Black), 1575 (American
   Indian/Alaskan Native), 2401 (Hispanic/Latino), and 2653 (non-Hispanic
   White) counties. Compared to counties included in any analysis,
   counties included in the analysis for non-Hispanic Black residents had
   lower mean CWS arsenic (1.17 µg/L vs. 1.42 µg/L) and uranium (2.5 µg/L
   vs. 3.45 µg/L) concentrations, a lower percentage of CWSs reliant on
   groundwater, and a lower percentage of the population living in rural
   areas. Counties included in the analysis for American Indian/Alaskan
   Native residents had larger population size and density and the lowest
   percentage of the population living in rural areas. Counties included
   in the analysis for Hispanic/Latino residents had higher mean CWS
   uranium (3.38 µg/L vs. 3.45 µg/L) concentrations. No counties were
   excluded for having <100 residents in the analysis for non-Hispanic
   White residents, and therefore these counties are the same as all
   counties included in any analysis.

   concentrations and sociodemographic characteristics for all counties
   included in any analysis (N = 2631 counties), and separately for
   counties included in analyses specific to each racial/ethnic group
   (counties with >100 residents of each racial/ethnic group)

Spatial lag regression

   To identify nationwide inequalities in CWS arsenic and uranium by
   racial/ethnic composition, we quantified the association between
   county-level racial/ethnic composition and CWS arsenic and uranium
   separately for each of the four racial/ethnic groups using spatial lag
   regression models with an autoregressive correlation structure to
   account for spatial dependence (see Methods section: Statistical
   analysis: spatial lag regression)^[120]34. We evaluated the geometric
   mean ratios (GMRs) and corresponding percent differences in CWS arsenic
   and uranium concentrations per a 10 percent higher proportion of
   residents belonging to each racial/ethnic group in progressively
   adjusted models (Table [121]2).
   Table 2 Geometric mean ratios (95% CI) of county-level community water
   system (CWS) arsenic and uranium concentrations per a 10 percent higher
   proportion of non-Hispanic Black, American Indian/Alaskan Native,
   Hispanic/Latino, and non-Hispanic White residents, from spatial lag
   regression models
   [122]Full size table

   Our main model of interest (Model 1) adjusted for population density,
   the percent of public drinking water sourced from groundwater supplies,
   median household income, and the percent of adults with a high school
   diploma. Effect estimates were considered statistically significant
   when 95% confidence intervals did not cross the null (GMR of 1 and
   percent change of 0). In fully adjusted models (Model 1), the percent
   increase in the geometric mean (95% CI) of CWS metal concentrations per
   10% higher proportion of Hispanic/Latino residents was 6% (4, 8) for
   arsenic and 17% (13, 22) for uranium. For a 10% higher proportion of
   American Indian/Alaskan Native residents, the percent increase in the
   geometric mean (95% CI) of CWS metal concentration was 7% (3, 11) for
   arsenic and 2% (-4, 8) for uranium. For a 10% higher proportion of
   non-Hispanic Black residents, the percent decrease in the geometric
   mean (95% CI) of CWS metal concentration was 8% (10, 6) for arsenic and
   9% (13, 5) for uranium. The percent decrease in the geometric mean (95%
   CI) of CWS metal concentrations for a 10% higher proportion of
   non-Hispanic White residents was 1% (2, 0) for arsenic and 5% (8, 3)
   for uranium. Models further adjusting for the composition of other
   racial/ethnic groups yielded similar results (Model 2).

   We performed several sensitivity analyses, all with similar findings.
   Adjusting for the CDC/ATSDR's county-level index of socioeconomic
   status^[123]35 (rather than median household income and the percent of
   adults with a high school education) yielded similar findings,
   supporting that the adjustment for income and education in Model 1
   (derived from our conceptual framework in Supplementary Fig. [124]1)
   was able to capture socioeconomic status. We conducted several
   additional sensitivity analyses that also yielded robust findings,
   including: further adjustment for the total number of non-Hispanic
   White residents, using county-level 95th percentile CWS arsenic and
   uranium concentrations (rather than the mean), assessing higher
   proportions of residents in a given racial/ethnic group corresponding
   to the interquartile range and 60% (rather than 10%), without
   adjustment for population density, and after restriction to counties in
   the western US where CWS arsenic and uranium are highest (see Methods:
   Statistical analysis: spatial lag regression and Supplementary
   Table [125]1). As a complementary analysis to our assessment of higher
   proportions of non-Hispanic White residents, we also assessed the
   association per a 10% higher proportion of all residents who were not
   categorized as non-Hispanic White, including non-Hispanic Black,
   American Indian/Alaskan Native, Hispanic/Latino, non-Hispanic Asian,
   Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander, and all residents in other
   racial/ethnic categories. For a 10% higher proportion of these
   residents (all residents who were not categorized as non-Hispanic
   White), the percent increase in the geometric mean (95% CI) was 1% (-1,
   3) for arsenic and 10% (6, 14) for uranium (results are shown in
   Supplementary Table [126]2). Because this association persisted even
   after combining all residents not categorized as non-Hispanic White,
   these complementary findings support the general hypothesis and leading
   theoretical framework on water exposure disparities- that white
   supremacy and structural racism are associated with drinking water
   inequalities^[127]23. However, the specific mechanisms underlying these
   disparities (e.g., infrastructure investments or management decisions
   specifically benefiting non-Hispanic White communities, etc.) are
   beyond the scope of this analysis. Findings were also similar for
   barium and selenium (Supplementary Table [128]3).

Geographically weighted regression

   To assess local inequalities in CWS arsenic and uranium by
   racial/ethnic composition we next explored the strength and direction
   of the association between racial/ethnic composition and CWS arsenic
   and uranium, and evaluated spatial non-stationarity in the effect
   estimates via geographically weighted regression models (see Methods
   section: Statistical analysis: Geographically weighted regression).
   County-specific coefficients from the geographically weighted
   regression analysis for each racial/ethnic group and CWS arsenic and
   uranium are displayed in Figs. [129]2 and [130]3, respectively. County
   colors represent the magnitude of the local GMR of CWS metals for a 10%
   higher proportion of residents in each specified racial/ethnic group,
   with positive associations (GMR > 1) displayed in red and inverse (GMR
   < 1) associations displayed in blue. Positive associations imply that
   the CWS metal concentrations are higher in the county than predicted
   from the regression model, potentially due to local-scale
   heterogeneity.

   residents from geographically weighted regression models.
   [131]figure 2

   Models were adjusted for population density, the percent of public
   drinking water supplied from groundwater sources, median household
   income, and the percent of residents with a high school diploma.
   Counties with a positive effect estimate (GMR > 1) are shown in red
   scale colors, counties with a negative effect estimate (GMR < 1) are
   shown in blue scale colors, and counties where a null effect estimate
   was observed are shown in white. Counties with missing data are shown
   with light gray hatch marks. The number of counties included in the
   geographically weighted regression analysis for each racial/ethnic
   group were: non-Hispanic Black (n = 1848), American Indian/Alaskan
   Native (n = 1522), Hispanic/Latino (n = 2341), and non-Hispanic White
   (n = 2585). Photocopy-friendly versions of these maps (contrasts
   visible in black and white) are available in Supplementary Fig. [132]8.

   Models were adjusted for population density, the percent of public
   drinking water supplied from groundwater sources, median household
   income, and the percent of residents with a high school diploma.
   Counties with a positive effect estimate (GMR > 1) are shown in red
   scale colors, counties with a negative effect estimate (GMR < 1) are
   shown in blue scale colors, and counties where a null effect estimate
   was observed are shown in white. Counties with missing data are shown
   with light gray hatch marks. The number of counties included in the
   geographically weighted regression analysis for each racial/ethnic
   group were: non-Hispanic Black (n = 832), American Indian/Alaskan
   Native (n = 778), Hispanic/Latino (n = 1170), and non-Hispanic White (n
   = 1174). Photocopy-friendly versions of these maps (contrasts visible
   in black and white) are available in Supplementary Fig. [135]8.
   [136]Full size image

   We observed spatial non-stationarity in the associations between
   racial/ethnic composition and CWS metal concentrations for all
   racial/ethnic groups for both arsenic and uranium, with different
   associations at the local level for each racial/ethnic group. Although
   the GMRs of CWS metal concentrations per a 10 percent higher proportion
   of non-Hispanic Black residents were inverse in nationwide spatial lag
   regression models (Table [137]2), geographically weighted regression
   indicated a positive association for CWS arsenic and uranium in areas
   where these CWS concentrations are high (particularly in the southwest,
   see Fig. [138]1). This was particularly evident for arsenic in western
   Texas, Arizona, California, Nevada, Utah, Oregon, and Washington, and
   for uranium in Arizona, California, Nevada, Oregon, and Oklahoma where
   we observed positive associations of higher magnitude (Figs. [139]2 and
   [140]3). Similarly, we observed a positive association between higher
   proportions of American Indian/Alaskan Native residents and CWS arsenic
   and uranium in the Northern Plains and in the west, particularly across
   Oregon, Washington, Montana, North Dakota and South Dakota, Minnesota,
   and Wisconsin for arsenic, and California, Nevada, Oregon, North
   Dakota, and Wisconsin for uranium. Findings for Hispanic/Latino
   residents were more consistent with findings from global spatial lag
   models, with significant, positive associations between higher
   proportions of Hispanic/Latino residents and CWS arsenic and uranium
   across most of the conterminous US. As anticipated, we observed higher
   model goodness-of-fit in areas with higher CWS metal concentrations and
   better spatial coverage of CWS arsenic and uranium estimates
   (Supplementary Figs. [141]3 and [142]4). Associations and
   goodness-of-fit for selenium and barium also differed locally and are
   presented in Supplementary Figs. [143]5 and [144]6.

Discussion

   Our study provides new evidence that racial/ethnic composition is
   associated with public drinking water arsenic and uranium
   concentrations, adding to a growing body of literature characterizing
   nationwide environmental and racial injustices in US public drinking
   water
   contaminants^[145]16,[146]17,[147]18,[148]19,[149]20,[150]26,[151]27,[1
   52]28,[153]29. Although our analysis was informed by a strong
   conceptual framework (see Supplementary Fig. [154]1) and other
   previously well-developed frameworks describing how disparities in
   drinking water exposures result from structural and environmental
   racism^[155]20,[156]21,[157]22,[158]23,[159]24, our study is
   descriptive in nature and is not intended to identify mechanisms by
   which racial/ethnic public water concentration disparities were created
   or reinforced.

   As predicted, nationwide analyses indicated that a higher proportion of
   non-Hispanic White residents was associated with lower CWS arsenic and
   uranium, while a higher proportion of Hispanic/Latino and American
   Indian/Alaskan Native residents was associated with higher CWS arsenic
   and uranium. These findings remained robust across several sensitivity
   analyses considering alternative adjustment approaches and alternative
   magnitudes of change in racial/ethnic composition, and are also
   consistent with previous studies utilizing non-geospatial approaches at
   the water system level^[160]20,[161]26,[162]29. These findings likely
   reflect structural environmental racism and white supremacy and
   privilege.

   Structural racism refers to the "totality of ways in which societies
   foster racial discrimination, through mutually reinforcing inequitable
   systems (in housing, education, employment, earnings, benefits, credit,
   media, health care, criminal justice, and so on)"^[163]36,[164]37.
   Structural racism serves to maintain white supremacy, in part, by
   amassing resources for and benefiting white communities to the
   detriment of communities of color^[165]38,[166]39,[167]40. Extensive
   research in the fields of sociology and epidemiology support that
   racism is a fundamental cause of disease and producer of health
   inequalities across racial/ethnic groups^[168]41,[169]42,[170]43.
   Structural racism produces health inequalities for marginalized
   communities through numerous mechanisms, including through the creation
   and perpetuation of inequalities in toxic environmental exposures,
   social determinants of health, and other psychosocial
   stressors^[171]36,[172]37,[173]39,[174]44,[175]45,[176]46. Prior
   studies identifying the specific mechanisms underlying water
   inequalities are abundant, although responsible mechanisms differ
   across contaminants, geographic regions, and the sociodemographic
   characteristics of impacted communities. Briefly, previous studies have
   identified community linguistic isolation, selective enforcement of
   drinking water regulations, the underbounding of communities of color
   from municipal boundaries and water services, and the direct
   withholding of resources and infrastructure investments as examples of
   mechanisms responsible for producing and maintaining inequalities in
   exposure to regulated drinking water
   contaminants^[177]23,[178]26,[179]47,[180]48,[181]49. For example,
   inequalities in public water lead exposure are related to changes in
   water supply sources, corrosion control, service line infrastructure
   investments, and targeted tap sampling for compliance
   monitoring^[182]32,[183]50,[184]51,[185]52,[186]53. Similar mechanisms
   may underlie the unequal distribution of arsenic and uranium
   concentrations in CWS observed in this study, although additional
   research is needed to evaluate those mechanisms in detail.

   Consistent with our other prediction that these associations would
   differ across geographic regions due to underlying geologic context,
   (i.e., water metal concentrations are influenced by natural composition
   of rocks and soil, and anthropogenic contamination from industrial
   activity, mining, agriculture)^[187]2,[188]3,[189]5 we found larger
   effect estimates from geographically weighted regression models in the
   southwestern US where water arsenic and uranium are high, and smaller
   effect estimates in other regions where these concentrations of these
   contaminants are low (i.e., the southeast). Taken together, these
   findings also suggest that communities with higher proportions of
   Hispanic/Latino and American Indian/Alaskan Native residents may be
   served by public water systems with elevated concentrations of other
   contaminants that were not evaluated in the present study, especially
   for contaminants that are present at meaningful concentrations in the
   geographic area.

   There are several potential explanations for the observed inverse
   relationship between the proportion of non-Hispanic Black residents and
   CWS arsenic and uranium concentrations in nationwide analyses. First,
   nationwide, non-Hispanic Black residents are more likely to live in
   urban areas^[190]54,[191]55, and therefore may be more likely served by
   large urban CWSs which have higher economies of scale and can implement
   more health protective water treatment systems and decisions. Cities
   with higher proportions of non-Hispanic Black residents are also more
   likely located in the eastern and southeastern US, where CWS arsenic
   concentrations are low. Although the majority of Hispanic/Latino
   residents also live in urban areas, these residents are also more
   likely to live in the southwestern US where groundwater arsenic and
   uranium concentrations are naturally high^[192]19,[193]56,[194]57. This
   explanation is supported by our findings from geographically weighted
   regression (Figs. [195]2 and [196]3) and the analyses restricted to
   western counties (Supplementary Table [197]1), which indicated that a
   higher proportion of non-Hispanic Black residents was associated with
   higher CWS arsenic and uranium in the southwest, but not in the
   southeast where arsenic and uranium water concentrations are low
   (Fig. [198]1). These findings suggest that racial/ethnic inequalities
   in public water contaminant exposures may be more likely or more severe
   in geographic regions with both a high percentage of public water users
   of the specified racial/ethnic group and relatively high concentrations
   of specific contaminants in source water. Additional public water
   contaminants beyond metals should be also assessed, as these will
   likely display different nationwide geographic patterns which may
   overlap with areas where a majority of residents are non-Hispanic
   Black^[199]23,[200]24. Future studies should assess these differences
   in analyses stratified by urban/rural areas to evaluate these potential
   explanations. Additionally, in areas of the US where non-Hispanic Black
   and American Indian communities rely heavily on private wells (the
   rural southeast and the rural Great Plains and southwest,
   respectively), public water systems may predominantly serve
   non-Hispanic White residents. Therefore, it is possible that the
   current analysis may underestimate the impact of community
   racial/ethnic composition on public water arsenic and uranium for both
   non-Hispanic Black and American Indian communities in these particular
   areas.

   Across all analyses, our findings were largely consistent for arsenic
   and uranium, likely reflecting the clustering and co-occurrence of
   arsenic and uranium in public water systems which has been previously
   described in detail^[201]16. The co-occurrence of arsenic and uranium
   has been documented in both regulated and unregulated water
   supplies^[202]16,[203]19,[204]32,[205]58,[206]59, and may be related to
   carbonate complexes increasing the solubility of arsenic and uranium,
   and/or the presence of bicarbonate ions in oxic water sources
   (bicarbonate ions may be especially relevant for the continued
   co-occurrence of arsenic and uranium in treated
   water)^[207]60,[208]61,[209]62.

   Our findings are particularly relevant to public health because there
   is no safe level of exposure to inorganic arsenic and
   uranium^[210]2,[211]3. At moderate to high levels of exposure,
   inorganic arsenic is associated with a number of adverse health
   outcomes including diabetes, lung disease, neurologic effects, kidney
   disease, and birth outcomes including low birth weight and impaired
   neurodevelopment; inorganic arsenic is also associated with
   cardiovascular disease and increased oxidative stress even at low to
   moderate exposure levels common in the US
   population^[212]1,[213]5,[214]63,[215]64,[216]65,[217]66. Uranium
   exposure is associated with kidney disease, including kidney cancer,
   and neurologic and cardiovascular disease, although evidence for other
   adverse health outcomes is more
   limited^[218]2,[219]6,[220]9,[221]10,[222]67. Although the effect
   estimates described in the current study are small to modest, their
   public health implications may be substantial when considered across
   the entire population. Several studies have identified disparities in
   health outcomes across racial/ethnic groups that are related to uranium
   and arsenic exposure. For example, American Indian/Alaskan Native
   populations experience substantially higher rates of kidney cancer
   compared to non-Hispanic White populations, especially in the
   Southwestern US where uranium exposures and co-exposures to arsenic and
   other metal mixtures are relatively high as a result of the uranium
   mining activity that occurred over the past
   century^[223]19,[224]58,[225]59,[226]68. For example, the mean uranium
   concentration in urine (biomarker of internal dose) among pregnant
   women living in the American Indian Reservations in the Southwest is
   2.67-2.8 times higher compared to the general US population^[227]69.

   Our study has several limitations. First, our nationwide evaluation of
   the county-level association between racial/ethnic composition and CWS
   metal concentrations may mask associations operating at finer
   geographic resolutions (e.g. within states, or across Census blocks or
   zip-codes)^[228]21,[229]70. We were not able to evaluate these
   associations at finer geographic resolutions because nationwide CWS
   concentration estimates are not yet available at these levels of
   aggregation (there is currently no publicly available, nationwide map
   of public drinking water system distribution boundaries that can be
   used to generate concentration estimates at these resolutions). Future
   studies at smaller spatial scales and with finer geographic resolution
   may also address the substantial differences in county size across the
   US. Larger county sizes may lead to larger measurement error, which may
   especially impact findings in the western US compared to the eastern US
   where counties areas are smaller. One recent study at the Census-block
   level in California also found significant associations between higher
   proportions of residents of color and drinking water arsenic
   concentrations, suggesting that these associations are likely also
   present for other states in the southwestern US^[230]71. Although some
   studies have evaluated sociodemographic characteristics of the
   "city-served" by CWSs, which is reported in the US EPA's Safe Drinking
   Water Information System (SDWIS), approximately half of all public
   water systems did not report "city-served" in SDWIS^[231]24,[232]72. In
   future studies, available water system distribution maps can be used to
   determine if "city-served" as reported in SDWIS provides a reasonable
   approximation of water system distribution boundaries nationwide.

   Second, although our nationwide, county-level analysis was intended to
   minimize selection bias, we restricted our analyses to counties with at
   least 100 residents in the racial/ethnic group of interest to avoid
   positivity violations, and this may have introduced selection bias.
   Counties excluded from analysis under this criterion had smaller
   population sizes, lower population densities, a higher percentage of
   residents living in rural areas, higher proportions of non-Hispanic
   White residents, and higher CWS arsenic and uranium concentrations
   (Supplementary Table [233]4). We did not assess associations for Asian
   and Native Hawaiian or Pacific Islander groups because no counties had
   >60% of residents for these groups. Future analyses can assess these
   associations at finer geographic resolutions, restricted to areas with
   larger populations of interest. We relied on Census bridged race
   categorized data, which does not capture several domains of
   racial/ethnic composition and could lead to misclassification. In
   addition, our analyses for uranium were limited by the relatively poor
   spatial coverage in CWS uranium concentration estimates, especially for
   the eastern and southeastern US. The CWS uranium concentrations used
   here are based on the most recently available CWS uranium monitoring
   records made publicly available by EPA, and are to our knowledge the
   most complete estimates currently available. Future studies can improve
   upon these estimates when EPA releases additional compliance monitoring
   records for the Fourth Six Year Review (expected 2023).

   Future studies should also evaluate the association between
   racial/ethnic segregation and inequalities in CWS metal concentration
   estimates, especially because prior analyses of noise exposure^[234]70
   and air pollution^[235]21,[236]73,[237]74 indicate that racial/ethnic
   segregation is associated with exposure inequalities. Geographically
   weighted regression indicated a positive association between larger
   proportions of non-Hispanic Black residents and CWS arsenic in parts of
   west Texas and the Midwest. These findings suggest that additional
   analyses at a finer geographic resolution should focus specifically on
   these particularly vulnerable geographic areas where metals in CWSs and
   soil are particularly high (public water system distribution boundaries
   are also publicly available for many of these states). Future analyses
   should also assess whether changes in racial/ethnic composition and
   migration patterns over time are associated with changes in CWS arsenic
   and uranium concentrations over time.

   Current US public drinking water infrastructure, management, and
   regulatory action does not adequately protect communities of color from
   elevated contaminant exposures. Recent federal infrastructure
   investment proposals have suggested targeting financial and technical
   support to small public water systems in rural and tribal areas, which
   experience substantial difficulties in achieving lower contaminant
   concentrations^[238]75. Findings from our current study add to a
   mounting body of evidence supporting that financial and technical
   support, infrastructure investments, and regulatory action must be
   directed towards supporting communities with larger populations of
   American Indian/Alaskan Native, Hispanic/Latino, and non-Hispanic Black
   residents. Given the known inequalities in public drinking water lead
   exposure for non-Hispanic Black communities across the US, specific and
   additional financial and technical support should also be directed to
   public water systems serving these communities to reduce elevated water
   concentrations and associated health outcomes. Racial/ethnic
   inequalities in public drinking water arsenic and uranium
   concentrations are unacceptable, and further research is needed to
   identify the specific mechanisms by which structural racism is
   operating to result in concentration inequalities for multiple
   regulated drinking water contaminants.

Methods

County-level public drinking water metal concentrations

   We utilized previously developed, county-level, population-weighted
   concentration estimates of arsenic, uranium, selenium, and barium
   concentrations in CWSs across the US, which were previously developed
   and described in detail^[239]17. These concentration estimates are
   based on the most recent publicly available nationwide monitoring data
   for public water systems. Briefly, county-level CWS metal concentration
   estimates were developed using routine compliance monitoring records
   compiled by the US Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) for the
   National Contaminant Occurrence Database supporting the Second and
   Third Six Year Review (SYR)^[240]76. The SYR database contains routine
   compliance monitoring records voluntarily submitted to EPA by primacy
   agencies including states and tribal authorities^[241]77,[242]78. CWS
   metal concentrations were averaged within a six-year period (2006-2011)
   for arsenic, selenium, and barium and within an eleven-year period
   (2000-2011) for uranium. These three- and eleven-year averages yield
   unbiased concentration estimates by accounting for the different
   compliance monitoring periods defined by EPA's Standardized Monitoring
   Framework requirements for arsenic (regulated under the Chemical
   Contaminants Rule and the Final Arsenic Rule) and for uranium
   (regulated under the Radionuclides Rule)^[243]17. Average metal
   concentrations at the county-level were calculated by weighing the
   average concentration for each CWS within the county by the size of the
   population served by each CWS. County-level CWS metal averages are
   missing when a) no compliance monitoring records were submitted for
   that county to the SYR, or b) CWSs serving that county reported serving
   <50% of the public-water reliant population in the entire
   county^[244]17. All county-level CWS metal variables were right skewed
   and natural log-transformed for analysis.

County-level racial/ethnic composition and sociodemographic data

   County-level racial/ethnic composition variables were derived from 2010
   US Census Population Estimates and included the proportion of residents
   who are American Indian or Alaskan Native (hereafter referred to as
   American Indian/Alaskan Native), non-Hispanic Asian, Native Hawaiian or
   Other Pacific Islander, Hispanic or Latino (hereafter referred to as
   Hispanic/Latino), non-Hispanic Black or African American (hereafter
   referred to as non-Hispanic Black), and non-Hispanic White. We selected
   sociodemographic variables from time periods that overlapped with the
   time period of the CWS arsenic and uranium concentration estimates
   (2006-2011). The percent of adults with a high school diploma was
   derived from the 2007-2011 US Census American Community Survey. Median
   household income was derived from the 2011 Small Area Income and
   Poverty Estimates and 2010-2011 National Center for Education
   Statistics data. We also downloaded the CDC/ATSDR's 2014 county-level
   index for socioeconomic status, which we adjusted for in sensitivity
   analyses rather than adjusting for median household income and the
   percent of adults with a high school diploma (the CDC's county-level
   index for socioeconomic status is a rank-order index for all counties
   in the US based on the percent of adults living below the federal
   poverty line, the percent of unemployed adults, median household
   income, and the percent of adults without a high school
   diploma)^[245]35. Although other variables which reflect socioeconomic
   status were available and are likely related to both racial/ethnic
   composition and CWS metal concentrations (such as the percent of the
   population living in rural areas, the percent of residents without
   health insurance, percent unemployment, percent of children eligible
   for free lunch, and percent of children living below poverty level),
   these variables did not open biasing paths on our conceptual diagram
   (Supplementary Fig. [246]1), and we therefore did not adjust for them.
   County total population and population density (population per square
   mile) were also retrieved from the 2010 US Census. We estimated the
   percent of public drinking water supplied by groundwater sources
   (versus surface water sources) from estimates of total groundwater and
   surface water withdrawn for public drinking water calculated by the US
   Geological Survey for 2010 (we used 2015 estimates for 20 counties
   which were missing estimates in 2010; the Spearman correlation
   coefficient between estimates for the two years was
   0.93)^[247]56,[248]57. A full description of all county-level variables
   used in this analysis is available in Supplementary Table [249]5. All
   data management and analysis were conducted in R version 4.0.3, except
   the assessment of spatial autocorrelation which was conducted in GeoDa
   version 1.18.0. For visualization, maps were generated in QGIS version
   3.10.

Exclusion criteria

   We restricted our analysis to conterminous US counties/county
   equivalents (N = 3158) because counties in Alaska and Hawaii have few
   neighboring counties and unique geological contexts impacting water
   contaminant concentrations. We further excluded 473 counties that did
   not have CWS concentration estimates available for either arsenic or
   uranium, 34 counties missing the percent of public drinking water
   supplied by groundwater sources, and 20 counties missing the percent of
   adults with a high school diploma. The county level CWS metal
   concentration estimates and sociodemographic characteristics for
   counties excluded from our analyses are presented in (Supplementary
   Table [250]4). After these exclusions, the total number of counties
   with CWS metal concentration estimates available was N = 2585 for
   arsenic and N = 1174 for uranium. No counties were missing
   racial/ethnic composition variables. We further restricted our analysis
   to assessing the association between county-level racial/ethnic
   composition and public drinking water metal concentrations for the
   proportion of non-Hispanic Black, American Indian/Alaskan Native,
   Hispanic/Latino, and non-Hispanic White residents. Analyses were
   conducted separately for each of the five racial/ethnic groups. We
   further restricted our analyses to counties with at least 100 residents
   in the racial/ethnic group of interest because very small population
   numbers could violate positivity assumptions (i.e., for some counties,
   the proportion of residents of a given racial/ethnic group would be
   zero or very near zero, and therefore effect estimates would be
   extrapolated beyond the range of actual values), or bias results if
   small increases in the absolute number of residents resulted in large
   percentage differences^[251]33. We selected 100 as the cut-point
   assuming most public water systems serve at least 25 households with an
   average of four residents per household (EPA defines public water
   systems as those that serve at least 15 service connections or 25
   people at least 60 days per year)^[252]79. We did not evaluate
   associations for the proportion of non-Hispanic Asian and Native
   Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander residents because no conterminous US
   counties had >60% of residents in these categories, a common cut-point
   to identify racial/ethnic majority areas in prior literature^[253]80.

Statistical analysis: descriptive data analysis

   To describe sociodemographic differences and differences in public
   drinking water metal concentrations across all counties in our analysis
   versus the counties included in the analysis for each racial/ethnic
   group, we described mean county-level CWS arsenic and uranium,
   concentrations, population size, population density, the percent of
   public drinking water supplied from groundwater sources, median
   household income, the percent of residents with a high school diploma,
   the percent of the population living in rural areas, and racial/ethnic
   composition across these county categories and presented them in
   Table [254]1. We also compared these characteristics across counties
   that were excluded from analysis to assess potential selection bias
   (Supplementary Table [255]4).

Statistical analysis: assessing spatial clustering

   We first explored spatial autocorrelation (spatial dependence) in
   county-level CWS metal concentration estimates across the US. We used a
   simple contiguity first order queen weighting matrix with binary values
   identifying neighbors (i = 1) and non-neighbors (i = 0). Counties with
   no neighbors were excluded. We evaluated the county-level association
   between the five racial/ethnic composition variables and CWS mean
   arsenic and uranium concentrations in 8 separate ordinary least squares
   (OLS) linear models, regressing each CWS metal on each of the four
   racial/ethnic composition variables (proportion of non-Hispanic Black,
   American Indian/Alaskan Native, Hispanic/Latino, and non-Hispanic White
   residents). To assess global spatial autocorrelation, we visually
   assessed the residuals from each OLS model and assessed Moran's I
   residual scatterplots and statistics for each CWS metal. The Moran's I
   statistic is the coefficient of best fit associated with the OLS line
   of best fit for each local unit's (i) standardized value plotted
   against the local unit's identified neighborhood (j) standardized
   average value of CWS metal concentration. To assess local spatial
   autocorrelation, we examined Local Indicators of Spatial Association
   (LISA) statistics, where every local unit's (I[i]) LISA score is the
   product of the standardized units' value (z[i]) relative to the average
   standard local values, multiplied by the sum of the weight matrix value
   times the neighborhood average value^[256]80.

Statistical analysis: spatial lag regression

   Because OLS residuals, Moran's I scatterplots, and Moran's I statistics
   (p < 0.001) all indicated global spatial autocorrelation for arsenic
   and uranium, and ignoring spatial autocorrelation violates assumptions
   of independence and can bias effect estimates^[257]34, we further
   assessed whether a spatial error or spatial lag model was most
   appropriate for our data using the Lagrange (Lag) Multiplier
   diagnostics function (lm.LMtest) in R using the package "spatialreg". A
   significant spatial lag or error term indicate that the residuals
   across spatial locations are correlated. Both the spatial lag and
   spatial error models returned p-values < 0.001, but we concluded that
   the spatial lag model was preferable to the spatial error model because
   the model estimates were larger^[258]81. A description of these
   diagnostic assessments for the OLS and spatial lag regression models
   are available in Supplementary Table [259]6.

   To quantify the association between county-level racial/ethnic
   composition and CWS metal concentrations, we evaluated spatial lag
   regression models with an autoregressive correlation structure
   separately for CWS arsenic and uranium concentrations and for each of
   the five racial/ethnic composition variables in R using the lagsarlm
   function from the "spatialreg" package^[260]82. We assessed the
   geometric mean ratio (GMR) and corresponding percent difference of CWS
   arsenic and uranium concentrations per 10% higher proportion of
   residents classified as non-Hispanic Black, American Indian/Alaskan
   Native, Hispanic/Latino, and non-Hispanic White. Fully adjusted models
   (Model 1) were adjusted for population density, the percent of public
   drinking water sourced from groundwater supplies, median household
   income, the percent of adults with a high school diploma. Model 2
   further adjusted for the proportion of the other racial/ethnic groups
   except for the proportion of non-Hispanic White residents. This
   "leave-one-out" modeling approach is useful when proportional variables
   sum to nearly 100% and higher proportions of one component occur
   simultaneously with lower proportions of at least one other component
   (this approach has been used in studies assessing arsenic metabolism,
   cell type ratios, and nutritional epidemiology)^[261]83. An example of
   the interpretation of the coefficient of interest from these models is
   as follows: in models assessing the proportion of Hispanic/Latino
   residents as the primary exposure, the coefficient for the proportion
   of Hispanic/Latino residents estimates the geometric mean ratio of CWS
   metal concentrations per 10% higher proportion of Hispanic/Latino
   residents because the proportion of non-Hispanic White residents is
   lower, controlling for the proportion of non-Hispanic Black and
   American Indian/Alaskan Native residents. We selected non-Hispanic
   White as the "leave-one-out" group because structural racism privileges
   and benefits this population group and we predicted that counties with
   lower proportions of these residents would have higher CWS metal
   concentrations. Because effect estimates from Model 1 and Model 2 were
   very similar, we selected the more parsimonious Model 1 as the main
   model of interest.

   We performed several sensitivity analyses. First, we repeated the
   analyses adjusting for Model 1 covariates and the total number of
   non-Hispanic White residents, with similar findings (results not
   shown). Second, we repeated the analyses using the county-level
   weighted 95^th percentile public drinking water metal concentrations
   (instead of the natural log-mean estimates), with similar findings
   although effect estimates were generally stronger (results not shown).
   Third, we repeated the analyses by assessing the geometric mean ratio
   of CWS arsenic and uranium per change in the proportion of a given
   racial/ethnic group that corresponds to (a) a 60% higher proportion of
   residents, a common cut-point to identify racial/ethnic majority areas
   in prior literature^[262]80, and (b) the value corresponding to the
   interquartile range for the proportion of residents in the specified
   racial/ethnic group, with similar findings for both approaches
   (Supplementary Table [263]1). Fourth, we repeated the spatial lag
   regression evaluating the association for higher proportions of
   American Indian/Alaskan Native residents without adjusting for
   population density because many communities and counties with a large
   proportion of these residents have relatively low population density
   (effect estimates for both arsenic and uranium were similar but
   stronger, results not shown). Fifth, we repeated our analyses after
   restricting to counties in the western US where county-level CWS
   arsenic and uranium estimates are highest (we defined the western US as
   Washington, Oregon, Idaho, Montana, Wyoming, North Dakota, South
   Dakota, Nebraska, Kansas, Oklahoma, Texas, New Mexico, Colorado, Utah,
   Arizona, Nevada, and California). Analyses restricted to western US
   generally yield similar findings although positive associations were
   identified for 10% higher proportions of non-Hispanic Black residents
   and uranium. However, these findings were limited by the small sample
   size (n = 296 counties; Supplementary Table [264]1). Finally, to
   complement our analyses assessing higher proportions of non-Hispanic
   White residents, we assessed the associations per a 10% higher
   proportion of all residents who were not categorized as non-Hispanic
   White, including non-Hispanic Black, American Indian/Alaskan Native,
   Hispanic/Latino, non-Hispanic Asian, Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific
   Islander, and all residents in other racial/ethnic categories. This
   sensitivity analysis is specifically intended to evaluate the
   prediction that higher proportions of non-Hispanic White residents is
   associated with lower CWS metal concentrations.

Statistical analysis: geographically weighted regression

   To explore the strength and direction of the association between
   county-level racial/ethnic composition and CWS arsenic and uranium
   concentrations and evaluate spatial non-stationarity in the effect
   estimates, we conducted geographically weighted regression using the
   "GWmodel" package in R version 4.0.3^[265]84. Geographically weighted
   regression models are exploratory, Gaussian-like, distance-based models
   that incorporate a spatial weighting function, combine geographic and
   attribute information, and obtain location-specific results. This
   approach provides a different regression output for each individual
   county, which allow us to assess variation across space in both (a) the
   magnitude and direction of the effect of racial/ethnic composition on
   CWS metal concentration, and (b) model goodness-of-fit. We ran separate
   geographically weighted regression models reproducing the separate
   models for CWS arsenic and uranium and for each of the four
   racial/ethnic groups that we previously assessed with global spatial
   lag regression models. Models were fully adjusted for population
   density, the percent of public drinking water sourced from groundwater
   supplies, median household income, and the percent of adults with a
   high school diploma (Model 1).
