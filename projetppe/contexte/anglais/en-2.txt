Reparative Justice for the Legacy of Enslavement

   Article 6 of the ICERD establishes the right to remedy and to seek just
   and adequate reparation for acts of racial discrimination such as
   enslavement, the many post-emancipation crimes against Black people in
   the United States, and the insufficiently remediated ongoing
   discriminatory structures. The US government has never adequately
--
   The ICERD requires States Parties to "assure to everyone within their
   jurisdiction effective protection and remedies, through the competent
   national tribunals and other State institutions, against any acts of
   racial discrimination" and to ensure "the right to seek from such
   tribunals just and adequate reparation or satisfaction for any damage
   suffered as a result of such discrimination."[24][10] The CERD has
   noted that the right to seek just and adequate reparation "is not
--
   remedies.[53][33] But [54]no progress has been reported as of this
   writing.[55][34] In sum, the US federal government continues to neglect
   its ICERD commitments to remedy the systemic, longstanding and grave
   legacy of enslavement and racial discrimination.

To address ongoing structural racism and legacies of enslavement, the US
should:

Mass Incarceration

   Article 2(1) of ICERD states that States Parties need to pursue the
   elimination of racial discrimination in all its forms. ICERD prohibits
   discriminatory practices and requires that States Parties "take
   effective measures to review governmental, national and local policies,
   and to amend, rescind or nullify any laws which have the effect of
--
   treatment before tribunals and all other organs administering
   justice";[57][36] and article 6 requires states to guarantee "effective
   protection and remedies, through competent national tribunals," against
   acts of racial discrimination.[58][37]

   The CERD has broadly articulated that "the mere fact of belonging to a
   racial or ethnic group . . . is not a sufficient reason, de jure or de

   now includes arrests, citations, and forced banishment of people
   through encampment clearances and property destruction by sanitation
   workers and police.[136][93] In cities like Los Angeles as well as
   elsewhere in the US, a long history of racial discrimination in
   housing, lending, employment, policing, and other factors (government
   policies like "urban renewal" and freeway construction included)  have
   led to high levels of Black homelessness.[137][94]
--
   probation and parole, and nearly all deny those rights to people in
   prison.[163][120]

To address racial discrimination in re-entry, US jurisdictions should:

     * Repeal US laws allowing and facilitating discrimination and/or
       exclusions based solely on an individual's arrest or conviction,
--
   Article 2(c), requires States Parties to "take effective measures to
   review governmental, national and local policies, and to amend, rescind
   or nullify any laws and regulations that have the effect of creating or
   perpetuating racial discrimination wherever it exists."[164][121] In
   its General Recommendation XXXI, the CERD recommended that States "pay
   the greatest attention" to "proportionately higher crime rates
   attributed to persons belonging to [racial minorities], particularly as
--
   countries, including those with extensive records of civil rights
   violations.[226][183]

To address racial discrimination by law enforcement in border control and
interior immigration enforcement:

     * Federal, state, and local authorities should reduce their reliance

   Black and brown workers' rights to fair pay and decent work conditions
   to the right to organize.

To address racial discrimination against migrants, the US should:

     * Conduct a thorough review of all current immigration laws to
       determine racial or discriminatory motivations or effects. Repeal

   "discriminatory bans" on entry to the United States, which had been
   implemented by former President Trump and rescinded by President Biden.
   Commentators have pointed to the way in which anti-Muslim animus long
   operated as a form of racial discrimination in the US immigration
   system, prior to these bans on entry.[245][202] While the current
   administration rescinded the "discriminatory bans," the administration
   has failed to adequately remedy past discriminatory exclusions
--
   Texas announced it would [288]return those suspected of being migrants
   to the border, raising a host of legal concerns.[289][242]

To address racial discrimination at the border, US jurisdictions should:

     * Expand the federal investigation into discriminatory treatment of
       non-citizens under Operation Lone Star to encompass Texas' new EO

Racial Discrimination in Public Services and Social Protection

   Article 5 of ICERD provides that "States Parties undertake to prohibit
   and to eliminate racial discrimination in all its forms and to
   guarantee the right of everyone" to economic and social rights,
   including protection against unemployment, the right to medical care,
   social security, social services, and education, and just conditions of

Public Health during the Covid-19 Pandemic

   Article 5 of ICERD provides that "States Parties undertake to prohibit
   and to eliminate racial discrimination in all its forms" in the right
   to "public health" and "medical care"[307][260] and provide equal
   access to healthcare services.[308][261] CERD has specifically mandated
   that states address the disproportionate impact of the Covid-19
--
     * Establish inclusivity policies that: support linguistic and racial
       diversity, including in federally qualified health clinics; and
       acknowledge, confront, and seek to remedy historic and current
       experiences of racial discrimination in public health, including by
       creating an official, confidential, and accessible complaint
       mechanism for patients who use federally qualified health
       facilities.

   systemic racism and other factors, this disproportionately impacts
   families of color.

To eliminate racial discrimination in the social safety net, the US should:

     * Increase benefit levels for social assistance and social insurance
       programs, including cash or in-kind assistance, including relevant

   neighborhoods generate and receive less funding and resources than
   those in wealthier neighborhoods with higher property values.[364][314]
   Racial disparities in education's connection to US property tax
   policies built in part on racial discrimination, racial segregation,
   and the legacies of slavery has been widely recognized, including by
   some US courts.[365][315] Poor conditions in these schools-such as
   "missing or unqualified teachers, physically dangerous facilities, and

   The US has [392]failed to implement these recommendations.[393][337]
   There are [394]no federal requirements or standards for teaching the
   history or racial discrimination in the US or about the history and
   cultures of Black Americans and other people of color, and only a
   handful of states mandate that such history be taught.[395][338] Even
   where mandates exist, each US state may teach in a way that leads to
--
   self-esteem of Black students, it conveys historical realities to all
   students and encourages empathy, understanding, and efforts to avoid
   repeating the racist violence of the past.[398][341] Further, denying
   the historical and contemporary realities of racial discrimination
   impedes not only justice and accountability for historic wrongs, but
   the eradication of persisting structures of racial inequality that is
   the core purpose of ICERD.

       Title VI and relevant statutes to ensure non-discrimination in the
