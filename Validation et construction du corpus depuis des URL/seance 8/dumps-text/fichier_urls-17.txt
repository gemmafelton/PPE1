   While local Coca-Cola bottlers are dealing with unhappy drivers, some
   staff members at a major supplier to the likes of ABI, SABMiller and
   Heineken are complaining of systematic racial discrimination.

   Employees of Krones SA, which makes the machinery that fills Coke,
   Valpré and beer bottles across the country, have approached the
   multinational’s German headquarters with allegations of preferential
   treatment for white staff members.

   In one incident, a white manager came to work sporting an old South
   African flag on his jacket, a number of employees said in an email seen
   by the Mail & Guardian – just as the country was caught up in the
   furore over Penny Sparrow’s controversial race statements.

   “I was shocked when I saw this. It was inappropriate and the only
   reason he wore it was to show that black employees’ feelings are
   irrelevant,” said one of the employees, who chose to remain anonymous.

   Krones consultant Lara Keromosemito said the man was not supposed to
   have been working that day and had only come in to conduct interviews.
   “I wasn’t there that day but, as far as I understand, he took the
   jacket off before conducting the interviews. But that is not an
   excuse,” she said.

   The man was fired. But for employees, the incident was indicative of a
   bigger problem. According to anonymous emails, most managerial
   positions are occupied by white people.

   Krones SA managing director Heiko Feuring agreed that the firm’s
   managerial level was predominantly white in nature.

   “This is due to the fact that we are a very technically oriented
   company and at the supervisory level we have about four nonwhites, but
   team leaders can also be seen as supervisors and we have many of them.

   “We have never made any decisions based on skin colour because we are a
   business and our mother company is pushing for business. The
   significant growth we have achieved shows that we have chosen the best
   people for the job,” he said.

   Feuring added that he understood the need for developing previously
   disadvantaged groups, including offering internship opportunities.

   “We have many examples of how we are developing employees. A previous
   cleaner who started with the company 22 years ago is now very
   successful in the service co-ordination department,” he said.

   “We also had a driver who used to pick up our guests from the airport.
   We have developed him and he is now a supervisor in one of our
   warehouses, responsible for R45?million worth of spare parts.

   “They are not on executive level yet, but we have to be fair and give
   it enough time. You cannot change the world in a day,” he said.

   Investigation underway
   But such instances are not enough to mollify staff when a white
   employee is allegedly paid more than a black colleague doing the same
   job.

   Last year, Krones hired two employees, one black and the other white.
   “The black employee has a BCom degree and has relevant work experience;
   his counterpart has a matric and no work experience in the finance
   field. They were hired to do the same job, but are not paid the same
   salary, with the white employee paid more than her counterpart,” said
   another employee.

   Feuring said in this case the white employee had been better able to
   negotiate after both were offered the same salary. “Just because
   someone has a degree, it doesn’t mean that we will offer him or her
   more money,” he said.

   Anonymous emails also alleged that employees’ family members are hired
   at the expense of qualified individuals.

   “The recruitment of relatives of some white employees and the HR [human
   resources] leadership seems to be becoming the norm, even though the
   company’s recruitment policy is against this practice,” reads the
   email.

   “For example, a qualified black intern in the service department was
   not awarded a permanent position and instead a relative of a white
   project manager was given preference for the same job, although the
   employee was new and did not have an equivalent qualification.”

   Andreas Horn, head of global human resources at Krones, said the
   company is against racism or any other form of discrimination. He
   acknowledged the emails and said a full investigation is underway.

   “As the accusations against HR employees at Krones SA are currently
   entirely anonymous, we are in the process of investigation. Therefore,
   we plan to conduct an extensive inquiry, which also includes a trip to
   South Africa.”
