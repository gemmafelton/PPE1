Introduction

   The United States signed the International Convention on the
   Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination ("ICERD" or
   "Convention") in 1966. President Lyndon Johnson's administration noted
   at the time that the United States "has not always measured up to its
   constitutional heritage of equality for all" but that it was "on the
   march" toward compliance.[15][1] The United States finally ratified the
   Convention in 1994 and first reported on its progress in implementing
   the Convention to the Committee on the Elimination of Racial
   Discrimination ("CERD" or "Committee") in 2000. In August 2022, the
   Committee will examine the combined 10^th - 12^th periodic reports by
   the United States on compliance with the Convention. This report
   supplements the submission of the government with additional
   information in key areas and offers recommendations that will, if
   adopted, enhance the government's ability to comply with ICERD.

   In its 2000 report, the United States stated that "overt
   discrimination" is "less pervasive than it was thirty years ago" but
   admitted it continued due to "subtle forms of discrimination" that
   "persist[ed] in American society."[16][2] The forms of discrimination
   reported to the United Nations by the United States included
   "inadequate enforcement of existing anti-discrimination laws";
   "ineffective use and dissemination of data"; economic disadvantage
   experienced by minority groups; "persistent discrimination in
   employment and labour relations"; "segregation and discrimination in
   housing" leading to diminished educational opportunities for
   minorities; lack of equal access to capital, credit markets and
   technology; discrimination in the criminal legal system; lack of
   adequate access to health insurance and health care; and discrimination
   against immigrants, among other harmful effects.[17][3] The United
   States also noted the heightened impact of racism on women and
   children.

   It has now been more than 50 years since the US signed the ICERD,
   nearly 30 years since it ratified the Convention, and more than 20
   since it identified the extensive foregoing list of impediments to its
   effective implementation. Yet progress toward compliance remains
   elusive--indeed, grossly inadequate--in numerous key areas including
   reparative justice; discrimination in the US criminal legal system; use
   of force by law enforcement officials; discrimination in the regulation
   and enforcement of migration control; and stark disparities in the
   areas of economic opportunity and health care. Structural racism and
   xenophobia persist as powerful and pervasive forces in American
   society.

   During his first days in office, President Joseph Biden called for
   urgent action to advance equity for all, calling this a "battle for the
   soul of [the] nation" because "systemic racism" is "corrosive,"
   "destructive" and "costly."[18][4] As this report and its annex,
   jointly authored by the American Civil Liberties Union and Human Rights
   Watch, demonstrate, the US has a great deal of work ahead to realize
   the promises of the ICERD.[19][5] This report therefore includes
   important recommendations in areas in which our organizations have
   specialized expertise, for addressing some of the US's most flagrant
   violations of the Convention. Additionally, although we recognize the
   political challenges facing the Biden Administration as it seeks to
   promote racial equity, we note that its recent declarations on racial
   justice are disconnected from the government's longstanding human
   rights obligations under the ICERD. The attached annex therefore
   identifies additional, more targeted measures to align President
   Biden's commitments with the ICERD. These measures are both fully
   within the control of the executive branch of the federal government
   and powerful enough to give life to the President's stated commitment
   to put "every branch of the White House and the federal government" to
   work in the effort to "eliminate systemic racism" in the United
   States.[20][6]

   President Biden has declared that racism, xenophobia, nativism, and
   other forms of intolerance are "global problems."[21][7] The ICERD is
   an important part of the solution and to confront these global problems
   effectively, the US should fulfill its obligations under the
   treaty.[22][8] This report and its detailed annex offer an initial
   roadmap for the US to do exactly that.


Reparative Justice for the Legacy of Enslavement

   Article 6 of the ICERD establishes the right to remedy and to seek just
   and adequate reparation for acts of racial discrimination such as
   enslavement, the many post-emancipation crimes against Black people in
   the United States, and the insufficiently remediated ongoing
   discriminatory structures. The US government has never adequately
   addressed the gross human rights violations perpetrated against Black
   people as part of chattel slavery or the exploitation, segregation, and
   violence unleashed on Black people that followed. The discrimination
   against Black people that is a legacy of enslavement persists and is
   perpetuated by economic, health, education, law enforcement, and
   housing, and other policies and practices that fail to adequately
   address racial disparities--part of the ongoing structural racism and
   racial subjugation that prevents many Black people from advancing, and
   facilitates police violence, housing segregation, and a lack of access
   to education and employment opportunities, among other things. States
   are obligated under the ICERD to overcome such structural
   discrimination, both through effective remedies--such as reparations
   and "special measures"--and through the Convention's obligation to
   "[t]ake steps to remove all obstacles that prevent the enjoyment of
   economic, social and cultural rights by people of African descent
   especially in the areas of education, housing, employment and
   health."[23][9]

   The ICERD requires States Parties to "assure to everyone within their
   jurisdiction effective protection and remedies, through the competent
   national tribunals and other State institutions, against any acts of
   racial discrimination" and to ensure "the right to seek from such
   tribunals just and adequate reparation or satisfaction for any damage
   suffered as a result of such discrimination."[24][10] The CERD has
   noted that the right to seek just and adequate reparation "is not
   necessarily secured by the punishment of the perpetrator of the
   discrimination" and that "the courts and other competent authorities
   should consider awarding financial compensation for damage, material or
   moral, suffered by a victim, whenever appropriate."[25][11] The UN has
   also established principles on the right of victims to remedies and
   reparations, and specifically set forth the right to reparations for
   people of African descent.[26][12] Although States generally only incur
   international responsibility for acts that are both internationally
   wrongful and attributable to the State, [27]this principle does not
   apply to slavery and its legacy.[28][13] While the US has enacted civil
   rights statutes since the 1950s, such legislation has been largely
   ineffective at curbing structural discrimination and racial inequality
   because of judicial decisions that significantly undermined their scope
   and meager government enforcement and investment, as well as the
   onerous requirements of discriminatory intent instead of discriminatory
   effect. Further, the US has [29]consistently indicated in its ICERD
   reporting that "inadequate funding" is one of the central reasons for
   insufficient federal enforcement.[30][14] The failure of the US to
   expand enforcement efforts and resources while acknowledging these
   widespread disparities over the last twenty-two years since it became a
   party to ICERD requires immediate redress.

   Reparative intervention for historical and contemporary racial
   injustice is urgent and required by ICERD.[31][15] The deep racial
   harms and unequal structures that are inextricably rooted in chattel
   slavery remain unremedied, perpetuating systemic inequality.
   [32]Scholars have estimated that the US benefited from 222,505,049
   hours of forced labor between 1619 and the end of slavery in 1865,
   which would be valued at $97 trillion today.[33][16] In 1860 alone,
   there were four million enslaved Africans whose labor is valued [34]at
   least $3 billion,[35][17] which was more than all the capital invested
   in railroads and factories in the United States [36]combined.[37][18]
   Enslaved people were subjected to brutal  [38]forced labor as well as
   formal and informal state-sanctioned discrimination that resulted in
   severe economic damage, in addition to psychological, social and
   political harm.[39][19]

   Black people in the US continue to endure severe economic disadvantages
   in wealth[40][20] and income[41][21] and suffer from discriminatory
   policies in land and home ownership,[42][22] denial of health
   care,[43][23] and segregation in education.[44][24] The resulting
   disparities are staggering: The average white family has roughly ten
   times the wealth of the average Black family and white college
   graduates have over seven times more wealth than Black college
   graduates.[45][25] With the current pace of growth in wealth among
   Black families, it will take an estimated 230 years for Black families
   to obtain the same amount of wealth that white families currently
   have.[46][26] About 21 percent of Black people in the United States
   live in poverty, more than double the rate for white people (8.8
   percent).[47][27] Although "these wealth disparities are rooted in
   historic injustices and carried forward by recent and ongoing practices
   and policies that fail to reverse inequitable trends,"[48][28] to date
   the US government has not done nearly enough to address the lasting and
   contemporary racially discriminatory effects of structures of
   inequality and racial subordination. It has also openly admitted to
   failing to provide sufficient resources for civil rights enforcement
   even though ICERD requires restitution, compensation, and
   restoration.[49][29]

   While the CERD has not yet made specific recommendations to the US with
   regard to reparative justice, the UN High Commissioner for Human
   Rights, in her 2021 report on systemic racism in law enforcement, urged
   the US (alongside other governments) to initiate reparations.[50][30]
   Although some localities have implemented reparation initiatives or
   commissions to address past racially motivated harms,[51][31]^there
   remains no formal nationwide federal initiative to advance reparations.
   Neither US courts nor other tribunals have provided reliable remedies
   for the descendants of enslaved people.[52][32] H.R. 40 - Commission to
   Study and Develop Reparation Proposals for African Americans Act, a
   bill currently before the House of Representatives, would establish a
   commission to study the effects of slavery and recommend appropriate
   remedies.[53][33] But [54]no progress has been reported as of this
   writing.[55][34] In sum, the US federal government continues to neglect
   its ICERD commitments to remedy the systemic, longstanding and grave
   legacy of enslavement and racial discrimination.

To address ongoing structural racism and legacies of enslavement, the US
should:

     * Establish a federal commission by legislative action or executive
       order to study and develop reparations proposals for the
       descendants of enslaved people.
     * Appropriate effective resources for federal economic and civil
       rights programs to address long-term structural racism and provide
       assistance to low-wealth and low-income Black communities.



Racial Discrimination in the Criminal Legal System

Mass Incarceration

   Article 2(1) of ICERD states that States Parties need to pursue the
   elimination of racial discrimination in all its forms. ICERD prohibits
   discriminatory practices and requires that States Parties "take
   effective measures to review governmental, national and local policies,
   and to amend, rescind or nullify any laws which have the effect of
   creating or perpetuating discrimination."[56][35] Additionally, Article
   5 guarantees equality before the law, including "the right to equal
   treatment before tribunals and all other organs administering
   justice";[57][36] and article 6 requires states to guarantee "effective
   protection and remedies, through competent national tribunals," against
   acts of racial discrimination.[58][37]

   The CERD has broadly articulated that "the mere fact of belonging to a
   racial or ethnic group . . . is not a sufficient reason, de jure or de
   facto, to place a person in pretrial detention"[59][38] and that States
   should "ensure that the courts do not apply harsher punishments solely
   because of an accused person's membership of a specific racial or
   ethnic group."[60][39] Additionally, the UN, in its 2021 common
   position on incarceration, stated that "incarceration should be used as
   a last resort," and recommended shifting to non-custodial
   alternatives.[61][40]

   The CERD has repeatedly emphasized profound concerns with the US
   criminal legal system, [62]first articulated in its 2001 Concluding
   Observations to the US, in which it noted that "the incarceration rate
   is particularly high with regard to African-Americans and
   Hispanics."[63][41] It thus recommended that the US take "firm action
   to guarantee the right of everyone, without distinction as to race,
   colour, or national or ethnic origin," to equal treatment before all
   organs administering justice.[64][42] In its most recent review, the
   Committee went further, expressing its concern that "members of racial
   and ethnic minorities, particularly African Americans, continue to be
   disproportionately arrested, incarcerated and subjected to harsher
   sentences, including life imprisonment without parole and the death
   penalty."[65][43] It specifically recommended that the US amend "laws
   and policies leading to racially disparate impacts in the criminal
   justice system" at all levels of government and implement "effective
   national strategies or plans of action aimed at eliminating structural
   discrimination."[66][44] In its 2021 submission, the US reported that
   the federal prison population had dropped to its lowest level since
   2000, "declining almost 31% since 2013,"[67][45] though it is worth
   noting that the federal prison population only represents about 10
   percent of the total US prison population.[68][46] Further, the federal
   prison population has grown under President Biden.[69][47] The US also
   cited the First Step Act, enacted by Congress in December 2018,[70][48]
   as central in making reductions possible. In its 2021 submission the US
   reported that of the total number of people who received reduced
   sentences as a result of the First Step Act, [71]91 percent were Black,
   which is consistent with the historic over-policing and overcharging of
   Black communities.[72][49] At the same time, the US failed to mention
   that its own Department of Justice (DOJ) found the risk assessment
   tool  the Prisoner Assessment Tool Targeting Estimated Risk and Needs
   (PATTERN) created by DOJ in connection with the First Step Act,
   resulted in racial disparities.[73][50] Despite repeated attempts at
   reform, the tool continues to overestimate the number of Black women
   who will engage in recidivism, compared to white women, and produces
   other racial disparities.[74][51]

   While some reforms have taken effect over the last decade, the US has
   failed to systematically address the immense breadth and depth of harm
   caused by its criminal legal system-harms that are the product of
   [75]deliberate [76]legal and policy choices created by a dominant white
   population supported by a culture of white supremacy.[77][52]

   US authorities hold almost two million people in detention and
   correctional facilities across the  [78]United States,[79][53] and they
   imprison Black people at a rate three times higher than [80]white
   people.[81][54] Black women are imprisoned [82]at a rate that is 1.7
   times the rate of white women.[83][55] While systemic discrimination
   against Black people is particularly blatant, the US also
   disproportionately punishes [84]Indigenous[85][56] and
   [86]Latinx[87][57] people.

   Racial discrimination is also deeply woven into the policing and
   charging practices that harass, target, and subject Black people and
   other people of color to the most severe punishments available. One out
   of seven people in prison are [88]serving a life sentence,[89][58] and
   [90]nearly half of that group is Black.[91][59] US authorities continue
   to apply the death penalty both discriminatorily and arbitrarily.

   In 2021, more than half of people executed were Black, and
   approximately 60% of people sentenced to death were [92]Black or
   Latinx.[93][60] Nearly 200 people on death row have been [94]exonerated
   since 1972--1 for every 8.3 people executed.[95][61] In fact, both
   death-row exonerees in 2021 were Black men imprisoned in Mississippi
   for nearly three decades because of [96]false forensic
   testimony.[97][62]

   Mass incarceration harms not only those incarcerated,
   disproportionately people of color, but entire communities. About
   [98]half of adults in the US have had an immediate family member
   incarcerated in jail or prison.[99][63] Black people are 50 percent
   more likely to have experienced familial incarceration than whites, and
   they are three times as likely to have had a family member incarcerated
   for [100]a year or longer.[101][64] [102]Research also shows that
   nearly half of incarcerated people in state prisons and almost 60
   percent in federal prisons are parents with minor children,[103][65]
   and Black children are six times more likely than their white peers to
   have had a [104]parent behind bars.[105][66]

   One of the most damaging aspects of mass incarceration in the United
   States is the harm caused to incarcerated people by dangerous and
   degrading conditions in prisons, jails, and other places of detention.
   Practices such as [106]solitary confinement,[107][67] [108]denial of
   adequate medical and mental healthcare,[109][68] and [110]sexual and
   other violence[111][69] cause lasting injury, and sometimes death, to
   those exposed to them. Because of space limitations, this report does
   not discuss these conditions of confinement in detail, but they are an
   inseparable element of the harm caused by mass incarceration.

To address the discriminatory impact of mass incarceration, the US should:

     * Reduce the role of police in addressing societal problems
       (including homelessness, mental health, and poverty) and invest
       instead in community-based non-carceral solutions to such societal
       problems.
     * Abolish the death penalty and consider the elimination of life, and
       virtual life, sentences; eliminate sentence enhancements and
       minimum-time-served requirements; and expand access to
       early-release mechanisms such as good-time credits, parole, and
       clemency. These legal changes should be extended to offenses
       classified as violent and applied retroactively.
     * Invest in crime prevention programs and alternatives to
       incarceration including community-based crisis intervention
       services that are trauma-informed, culturally competent, and do not
       exclude offenses classified as violent.
     * Record, maintain, track, and publicly disseminate data on
       convictions, sentencing, and incarceration including racial and
       ethnic demographics.

Youth/Juvenile Justice

   The [112]ICERD requires States to "pay the greatest attention possible
   with a view to ensuring that [children from racial minorities] benefit
   from the special regime to which they are entitled in relation to the
   execution of sentences."[113][70] Other prominent human rights bodies
   have reinforced this message. The Committee on the Rights of the Child
   (CRC) has stated that "particular attention must be paid to de facto
   discrimination and [racial] disparities"[114][71] and urged states to
   provide "appropriate support and assistance" to reintegrate young
   people who commit crimes.[115][72] In its most recent recommendations
   to the US, the CERD urged the US to intensify efforts to address the
   "school-to-prison pipeline," ensure that young people are not placed in
   adult criminal settings, and abolish life-without-parole sentences for
   people under eighteen.[116][73]

   Racial inequities pervade every stage of the juvenile legal system.
   Black and brown young people are more likely than their white peers to
   be stopped and harassed by the police.[117][74] This increases the
   likelihood of future arrest: Black young people who come into contact
   with the police by eighth grade have eleven times greater odds of being
   arrested in young adulthood.[118][75] Once arrested, Black young people
   are four times as likely to be detained as white young people.[119][76]
   Black young people comprise just fifteen percent of the US youth
   population, but forty-one percent of those confined in juvenile
   facilities.[120][77] Black children are also disproportionately likely
   to be charged as adults.[121][78] Indeed, eighty percent of young
   people serving life sentences are children of color, and more than
   fifty percent are Black.[122][79] The traumas of incarceration--which
   are especially acute for children in adult prisons and include sexual
   abuse, solitary confinement, and death by suicide--therefore fall too
   often on children of color, especially Black youth.[123][80]

To address the discriminatory impact of policies criminalizing youth:

     * Provide supportive services for and investment in child-centered,
       trauma informed youth programs, education, and mental health care.
     * Refrain from prosecuting children in adult court, utilizing
       incarceration as a last resort after other interventions have been
       tried, and instead treat them as children, with a focus on
       opportunities for education, healing, and healthy development
       instead of punishment.

Criminalization of Poverty - Homelessness, Bail, Fines, and Fees

   Beyond the general requirement that "all public authorities and public
   institutions, national and local" eschew racial
   discrimination,[124][81] the ICERD contains provisions that bear
   specifically on homelessness and poverty. Article 5(e) of the
   Convention addresses discrimination in protections against unemployment
   and the provision of social security and social services.[125][82]
   Additionally, Article 5(f) articulates a "right of access to any place
   or service intended for use by the general public."[126][83] In 2014,
   the CERD expressed concern over the "high number of homeless persons,
   who are disproportionately from racial and ethnic minorities," and the
   "criminalization of homelessness through laws that prohibit activities
   such as loitering, camping, begging and lying down in public
   spaces."[127][84] The Committee recommended abolishing laws
   criminalizing homelessness, and "intensify[ing] efforts to find
   solutions for the homeless, in accordance with human rights
   standards."[128][85]

   Although the US has previously acknowledged the CERD's
   concerns,[129][86] the criminalization of homelessness remains a
   pressing social problem across the United States--and one that
   continues to burden people of color disproportionately. In 2020, there
   were an estimated 580,000 unhoused people in the United States, 39
   percent of whom were Black, despite only being 12 percent of the US
   total population.[130][87] Fifty-three percent of unhoused families
   with children were Black. Native American, Native Hawaiian, and Pacific
   Islander people made up 1 percent of the US population, but 5 percent
   of the unhoused.[131][88] Many localities persist in criminalizing the
   presence of homeless persons in public places[132][89]--in essence,
   punishing people for lacking a home by prohibiting sleeping outside,
   loitering, or requesting assistance from others.[133][90] For instance,
   in one town near Los Angeles, California, only 1.3 percent of the
   population is homeless, but that group received a staggering 26% of all
   citations issued in the town by the Los Angeles Sheriff's
   Department.[134][91] Zealous targeting of homeless populations
   essentially for being homeless inexorably feeds a vicious cycle of
   escalating enforcement, generating misdemeanors, warrants, unpayable
   fines, and incarceration.[135][92] The criminalization of homelessness
   now includes arrests, citations, and forced banishment of people
   through encampment clearances and property destruction by sanitation
   workers and police.[136][93] In cities like Los Angeles as well as
   elsewhere in the US, a long history of racial discrimination in
   housing, lending, employment, policing, and other factors (government
   policies like "urban renewal" and freeway construction included)  have
   led to high levels of Black homelessness.[137][94]

   Poverty implicates issues of concern to CERD outside the context of
   homelessness as well. The US has conceded that, within the criminal
   legal system, some rights are contingent upon ability to pay. Although
   variation occurs across US states, the US has noted that "persons with
   felony convictions may ... have to pay any outstanding fees, fines, or
   restitution before [voting] rights are restored" upon release from
   incarceration.[138][95] While this statement indicates some recognition
   of the problem, the federal government's current actions are inadequate
   to remedy the immense harm to poor individuals stemming from the
   criminal legal system, a system that keeps the already marginalized in
   poverty.[139][96] In its most recent response to the CERD, the US fails
   to address the crushing effects of fines and fees accompanying
   low-level infractions, the accumulation of which affect the poorest in
   society, who pay the vast majority of these penalties.[140][97] A study
   in Tulsa, Oklahoma found that Black residents were disproportionately
   subject to county-based warrants that are often issued for minor
   infractions such as failure to pay court costs, fines, and
   fees.[141][98] The threat of rearrest for one's inability to afford
   mounting debt keeps people in a cycle of incarceration and forces
   families to decide between paying fines and fees and purchasing
   necessities such as diapers and formula for their
   children.[142][99]^Mothers are separated for lengthy periods of time
   from their children as a result of being held in custody, sometimes
   lengthened due to the fines and fees.[143][100]

   Furthermore, pretrial incarceration, often ordered by judges setting
   unaffordable money bail, disproportionately harms low-income and
   low-wealth people of color. In the case of bail, wealthy defendants are
   more able to secure their freedom while poor ones are forced to remain
   incarcerated, affecting their livelihoods and family ties.[144][101]
   Pretrial incarceration leads to increased likelihood of convictions and
   harsher sentences.[145][102] People held in jail pretrial are
   pressured to plead guilty to secure their release, regardless of their
   actual guilt or innocence.[146][103] Additionally, pretrial
   incarceration can result in even more fines and fees, as some jails
   bill detained people for each day of their detention.[147][104] These
   inequalities have troubling racial implications, as Black people are
   2.5 times more likely than white people to live in poverty and face
   much higher arrest rates.[148][105]

To address the criminalization of poverty, US states should:

     * Stop criminalizing homelessness and its inevitable consequences,
       which only further serves to penalize disadvantaged individuals
       already suffering from inadequate allocation of governmental
       resources.
     * Reduce the circumstances in which courts can order pretrial
       incarceration, through bail setting or other means, only to those
       in which there is strong evidence of imminent harm if a person is
       released pretrial, and only following a rigorous hearing to
       evaluate that evidence.
     * Invest in pretrial services programs providing court date
       reminders, transportation, and other support to ensure court
       appearances.
     * Drastically reduce the number and amounts of fines and fees in the
       US criminal legal system. Further, establish national standards for
       criminal-legal system debt, including guidelines on ability- to-
       pay determinations and collection practices.

Probation and Parole

   Probation and parole are portrayed as alternatives to incarceration,
   but in reality they drive high numbers of people--particularly Black
   and brown people--into jail and prison.[149][106] About 4 million
   people in the US are on probation or parole,[150][107] and nearly half
   of all state prison admissions stem from violations of the conditions
   of probation or parole.[151][108] Black people are 4.15 times more
   likely to be under supervision than white people, and remain on
   supervision longer than similarly situated whites.[152][109]

   Black people are also more likely to be incarcerated for supervision
   violations. Due to generations of structural racism, Black and brown
   people are less likely to have resources, such as housing, wealth,
   reliable transportation, and jobs, that make it feasible to complete
   the onerous requirements of supervision.[153][110] Meanwhile, they are
   disproportionately stopped, searched, and arrested by police--making
   them more likely to be incarcerated for probation or parole
   violations.[154][111] And some supervision conditions--such as
   requirements to stay away from people with felony
   records--disproportionately burden Black men, one in three of whom have
   a felony conviction.[155][112]

To address racial disparities in probation and parole, US authorities should:

     * Drastically reduce the use of supervision sentences for youth and
       adults and instead utilize real alternatives to incarceration.
     * Where supervision is used, shorten supervision periods, narrowly
       tailor conditions, and stop incarcerating people for violations
       that would not otherwise be a crime.

Reentry Issues - Impact of Criminal Records on Housing and Unemployment

   The ICERD requires States to take "special and concrete measures to
   ensure the adequate development and protection of certain racial groups
   or individuals belonging to them, for the purpose of guaranteeing them
   the full and equal enjoyment of human rights and fundamental
   freedoms,"[156][113]^including the right to work and the right to
   housing.[157][114] The Committee has raised concerns about persistent
   housing and employment racial disparities in the US.[158][115]

   The United States imposes more than 48,000 legal restrictions on people
   with criminal records--barring them from work, housing, jobs, and civic
   engagement.[159][116] These barriers disproportionately impact Black
   and brown people, who are more likely to have criminal
   records[160][117] and to face discrimination when attempting to access
   housing and employment.[161][118] Sixty-four percent of unemployed men
   in their thirties have criminal records, and Black men are almost twice
   as likely as white men to be unemployed.[162][119]

   Additionally, the high rate at which the US subjects Black people to
   correctional control results in their underrepresentation in the US
   electorate, as many US jurisdictions deny voting rights to people on
   probation and parole, and nearly all deny those rights to people in
   prison.[163][120]

To address racial discrimination in re-entry, US jurisdictions should:

     * Repeal US laws allowing and facilitating discrimination and/or
       exclusions based solely on an individual's arrest or conviction,
       including restrictions or exclusions from employment, housing,
       access to social benefits, and voting.

Racist Drug Laws and Racism in Public Health Approaches

   The ICERD guarantees the right to equal treatment generally and, under
   Article 2(c), requires States Parties to "take effective measures to
   review governmental, national and local policies, and to amend, rescind
   or nullify any laws and regulations that have the effect of creating or
   perpetuating racial discrimination wherever it exists."[164][121] In
   its General Recommendation XXXI, the CERD recommended that States "pay
   the greatest attention" to "proportionately higher crime rates
   attributed to persons belonging to [racial minorities], particularly as
   regards petty street crime and offenses related to drugs" as an
   indication of the "non-integration of such persons into
   society."[165][122] Additionally, the Joint United Nations Programme on
   HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS) has called for the "decriminalization of drug
   possession for personal use" and the "elimination of stigma and
   discrimination against people who use drugs."[166][123] In its 2014
   concluding observations to the US, the CERD expressed concern over "the
   application of mandatory minimum drug-offense sentencing policies" that
   exacerbate racial disparities in the criminal legal system.[167][124]
   Additionally, the UN Special Rapporteur on extreme poverty and human
   rights highlighted the "confused and counterproductive drug policies"
   in the US in his 2018 country report. The report described how, in the
   context of drug addiction in the US, the "main responses have been
   punitive," rather than the appropriate response of "increased funding
   and improved access to vital care and support."[168][125] The report
   further suggested that this "urge to punish" has "racial undertones,"
   noting the disparities in sentencing between Black users of crack
   cocaine and white users of opioids.[169][126] Similarly, the UN Working
   Group of Experts on People of African Descent has urged the US to amend
   any judicial policies that disproportionately target Black people,
   stating that "the war on drugs has operated more effectively as a
   system of racial control than as a mechanism for combating the use or
   trafficking of narcotics."[170][127]

   In its 2021 report to the CERD, the US pointed to the 2018 enactment of
   the First Step Act, a law that reduced racial disparities in sentences
   for certain drug crimes.[171][128] While these reforms are helpful,
   they do not do nearly enough to remedy past discriminatory treatment or
   change laws, policies and practices in ways that would prevent it in
   the future.

   Nearly 400,000 people are in prison for drug crimes.[172][129] The vast
   majority of individuals incarcerated in federal prison are there on a
   drug charge,[173][130] and by some estimates, nearly eighty percent of
   people in federal prison for drug offenses are Black or
   Latinx.[174][131] Though Black and white people use drugs at similar
   rates,[175][132] Black people are imprisoned for drug crimes at five
   times the rate of white people.[176][133] "Black people [a]re arrested
   at over three times the rate of white people, and up to eight times as
   often in some states," for marijuana offenses.[177][134] Additionally,
   police have targeted Black people specifically for federal prosecution,
   because "federal drug laws carry harsher punishment--including
   mandatory minimum sentences--than charges brought in state
   court."[178][135] Though some authorities have begun to embrace a less
   punitive, more health-based approach to substance use disorders, this
   shift is still far too limited, and only began to take place after
   years of especially harsh treatment of Black people as part of the War
   on Drugs amidst an opioid crisis associated primarily with white
   people.[179][136] Further, drug arrests-the vast majority for
   possession-remain the leading cause of arrest in the US.[180][137]

   Black people have in fact been hit the hardest by the opioid crisis in
   recent years, one that has only worsened since the Covid-19 pandemic
   began. One study shows a thirty-eight percent increase in overdoses
   among Black people between 2018 and 2019 across four states.[181][138]
   Additionally, some states have responded to the opioid crisis by
   passing drug-induced homicide laws, which seek to charge people with
   murder for selling drugs that may have led to an overdose. Such laws
   can result in the disproportionate prosecution of Black and Latinx
   people--providing another basis for subjecting individuals of color to
   lengthy prison terms for drug-related offenses.[182][139]


To make drug policy more rights-respecting, the US should:

     * Eliminate mandatory minimum sentences for drug offenses and repeal
       drug-induced homicide laws.
     * End sentencing disparities between crack cocaine and powder cocaine
       offenses.
     * Decriminalize possession of drugs for personal use.
     * Enact laws or otherwise encourage processes to review and clear
       past drug convictions, including a process to expunge convictions
       for marijuana sales as marijuana is legalized for sale and a means
       to invest resources obtained from marijuana licensing to
       communities most harmed by past prohibitions on marijuana.
     * Invest in treatment and harm-reduction programs to provide
       trauma-informed and culturally competent support to people living
       with substance use disorders.

Prison Labor

   ICERD Article 5 includes the rights to work, free choice of employment,
   just and favorable conditions of work, equal pay for equal work, and
   just and favorable remuneration.[183][140] Further, the guidelines for
   prison labor set out in the UN Standard Minimum Rules for the Treatment
   of Prisoners (the "Rules") prohibit work "of an afflictive nature,"
   require permitting incarcerated people to "choose the type of work they
   wish to perform," and mandate that such labor be supplemented with
   vocational training.[184][141] The Rules also state that the
   "precautions laid down to protect the safety and health of free workmen
   shall be equally observed in [correctional] institutions," and that
   "[p]rovision shall be made to indemnify prisoners against industrial
   injury, including occupational disease, on terms not less favorable
   than those extended by law to free workmen."[185][142]

   Almost one million people are currently working while confined in US
   prisons.[186][143] They often work in grueling and degrading conditions
   for little to no pay--often pennies on the hour--and under threat of
   punishment (including solitary confinement) for refusing to
   work.[187][144] US law explicitly excludes incarcerated workers from
   the most basic workplace safety guarantees, including the
   constitutional prohibition against involuntary servitude.[188][145]^The
   US prison labor system involves present-day involuntary servitude.
   Prison labor is also a legacy of slavery, and racial inequities persist
   today.[189][146] Black people are disproportionately incarcerated and
   thus overrepresented among those working in prison.[190][147] Black
   people also work lower-wage and unpaid agriculture and maintenance jobs
   at a disproportionate rate in prison, while a higher proportion of
   white people work in higher-paying prison-industries jobs.[191][148]
   Indeed, across the deep south, agricultural workers, largely Black,
   pick and harvest crops in prisons located on the sites of former slave
   plantations.[192][149]

To eliminate racial inequities in prison labor, the US should:

     * Abolish the Thirteenth Amendment's exclusion that allows forced
       labor as a punishment for a crime.
     * Ensure that all work in prisons is fully voluntary by eliminating
       any laws and policies enabling forced labor and that punish
       incarcerated people who are unable or unwilling to work.
     * Adopt legislation and regulations providing incarcerated workers in
       all prisons with the same labor protections afforded to other US
       workers including minimum wage, overtime pay, health and safety
       standards, unionization and collective bargaining, and protection
       from discrimination and retaliation.
     * Initiate oversight investigations into federal and state prisons to
       eliminate forced labor of incarcerated people and discriminatory
       pay, allocation of work assignments, conditions, and related
       practices.



Racial Discrimination and Excessive Force by Law Enforcement Officials

Racially-Disparate Policing and Enforcement Practices

   Article 5(b) of the ICERD requires States Parties to ensure equity in
   the right to be free from "violence or bodily harm, whether inflicted
   by government officials or by any individual group or
   institution."[193][150] Accordingly, the CERD has called on States
   Parties to improve the training of their law enforcement officials, and
   it has long expressed concern about police profiling, bias and
   brutality^(as well as attendant impunity) that disproportionately harms
   people of color in the United States.[194][151] The Committee even
   issued an Early Warning and Urgent Action Procedures Resolution after
   the police murder of George Floyd sparked unprecedented protests
   against police violence in 2020.[195][152]

   Despite warnings from the Committee and other international human
   rights bodies,[196][153] US police agencies have failed to meet their
   obligations under the ICERD. The US has discussed bringing federal
   lawsuits against problematic police agencies[197][154] and proposed
   some federal legislation that may (if passed) help to address some of
   these issues,[198][155] but legislation failed in the US Senate, and
   the executive order President Biden passed in response does not go
   nearly far enough to save lives.[199][156]

   People of color continue to bear the brunt of aggressive and
   discriminatory policing. Estimates attribute over 1,000 killings per
   year to the police,[200][157] and new research suggests that more than
   half of police killings are not reflected in official
   statistics.[201][158] Police also continue to kill Native Americans,
   Latinxs and Black people at significantly higher rates--as much as 350%
   more frequently--than white people.[202][159] Even greater racial
   disparities attend nonfatal uses of force by police,[203][160] and
   police likewise target people of color (especially Black people) for
   stops and arrests at much higher rates than white people.[204][161] The
   goal of limiting police violence in the US is linked to the need to
   correct imbalances between investment in services that directly address
   societal problems such as substance use disorders or poverty and
   investment in policing.[205][162]

   These substantial, persistent imbalances notwithstanding, impunity for
   abuse remains a widespread problem.[206][163] There are over 18,000
   policing agencies across the US,[207][164] but the US Department of
   Justice opened only 70 civil investigations into police departments for
   the possible violation of civilians' rights between 1994 and January
   2020.[208][165] More broadly, police rarely face prosecution or other
   legal consequences after engaging in brutality.[209][166] Additionally,
   much of the data needed to discern the extent of police compliance with
   the ICERD remain undisclosed.[210][167] For instance, federal efforts
   to create a use-of-force database for police have faltered due to
   widespread noncooperation from police departments-though President
   Biden's executive order on policing aims to address this
   problem.[211][168] In many US states, the disciplinary records of
   abusive officers are also largely hidden from the public,[212][169] and
   civil society groups and universities have had to take it upon
   themselves to cobble together a national database on police stops of
   civilians.[213][170]

To address excessive use of force in law enforcement, the US should:

     * Prohibit police from enforcing a range of non-serious offenses,
       including issuing fines and making arrests for non-dangerous
       behaviors, thus eliminating many of the unnecessary interactions
       between the police and community members that have led to so much
       violence and so many deaths.
     * Invest in communities to prioritize health and quality of life over
       law enforcement and surveillance.
     * Implement enforceable legal constraints so that there will be only
       rare instances in which police officers can legally use force
       against community members;
     * Create independent oversight structures with robust enforcement and
       subpoena powers that ensure that when officers use force in
       violation of the law, policies, or training, they are held
       accountable.

Racial Bias and Abuse by Law Enforcement in Immigration Control

   ICERD's prohibition of discrimination, including in Article 5(b) also
   bears on law enforcement at the US border and in interior immigration
   enforcement.[214][171] The CERD has recommended that "all officials
   dealing with non-citizens receive special training, including training
   in human rights," to combat ill-treatment and discrimination against
   non-citizens by police and law enforcement agencies.[215][172] In its
   2008 concluding observations to the US, the CERD expressed concern over
   the excessive use of force against migrants, recommending that the US
   establish "adequate systems for monitoring police abuses" and develop
   "further training opportunities for law enforcement
   officials."[216][173] In 2014, the Committee went further, reiterating
   concern about "increased use of racial profiling" by law enforcement to
   determine immigration status and recommending an end to specified
   immigration enforcement programs,[217][174] including the Secure
   Communities program[218][175] and the INA § 287(g) program.[219][176]
   The United States replied that Department of Homeland Security (DHS)
   policy prohibits racial profiling and that it issued new use of force
   policies and training.[220][177]

   Despite these policies and purported reforms, US Customs and Border
   Patrol (CBP) and Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officers
   continue to commit acts of violence and other serious abuses against
   migrants. Internal DHS reports revealed testimony regarding "over 160
   cases of misconduct and abuse of asylum applicants," including physical
   and sexual abuse.[221][178] Reports and statements from former CBP
   agents illustrate a departmental reluctance to "hold agents and others
   within the agency accountable."[222][179] Further, reports and images
   emerged in 2021 of "horse-mounted agents maneuvering their horses in a
   menacing way toward migrants, wielding lariats [whips], and using
   derogatory and xenophobic language" against primarily Haitian migrants,
   "including families with small children."[223][180] ACLU tracking has
   documented at least 230 fatal encounters with CBP since the agency was
   created.[224][181] Finally, while President   Biden's administration
   has attempted to limit deportations of people from the interior of the
   United States through an initial moratorium on deportations and
   subsequent "enforcement priorities" memos, [225][182] it has maintained
   programs that facilitate racial profiling in immigration enforcement
   such as the 287(g) program, Operation Stonegarden and the Secure
   Communities program, the 287(g) program is still widespread across the
   country. Through these programs, the Biden administration is partnering
   with xenophobic, anti-immigrant law enforcement agencies across the
   countries, including those with extensive records of civil rights
   violations.[226][183]

To address racial discrimination by law enforcement in border control and
interior immigration enforcement:

     * Federal, state, and local authorities should reduce their reliance
       on policing agencies and instead adopt a humanitarian approach to
       border reception and regulation, ensuring for example the primacy
       of human dignity, due process, family unity, non-discrimination,
       and the right to seek asylum.
     * The US should immediately review, investigate, and remedy all
       internal and external allegations of abuse by government officials
       at the border or in an immigration detention facility and initiate
       an investigation of a pattern and practice of rights violations by
       CBP. In addition, the US government should immediately end
       immigration detention that is unnecessary or prolonged with the aim
       to gradually abolish immigration detention and should close any
       immigration detention facility in which persistent abuses are
       committed.[227][184]
     * The US should end immigration programs that facilitate racial
       profiling, including the 287(g), Operation Stonegarden, and Secure
       Communities programs.



Racial Discrimination in the Regulation and Enforcement of Migration and
Refugee Laws

   ICERD protects non-citizens against discrimination on the basis of
   race, colour, descent, and national or ethnic origin, regardless of
   whether they are lawfully admitted to the territory of a State Party.
   The text of the Convention does not explicitly prohibit differential
   treatment on the basis of citizenship, but the CERD has clearly stated
   that, "differential treatment on the basis of citizenship or
   immigration status will constitute discrimination" under the Convention
   "if the criteria for such differentiation . . . are not applied
   pursuant to a legitimate aim, and are not proportional to the
   achievement of this aim."[228][185] Article 5 of ICERD further binds
   parties to eliminate discrimination and guarantee equality before the
   law in relation to several rights fundamental to non-citizens,
   including the right to equal treatment before tribunals, the right to
   freedom of movement within the borders of a state, and the right to
   leave any country, including one's own.[229][186] Article 6
   additionally requires States Parties to "assure to everyone within
   their jurisdiction effective protection and remedies" for instances of
   discrimination; this extends to non-citizens as well as
   citizens.[230][187]

   The United States has long acknowledged that "discrimination against
   immigrants" is one of the principal causative factors of the "subtle
   and elusive" forms of discrimination that "persist[s] in American
   society."[231][188] Indeed, the United States' combined first, second,
   and third report noted that there is a long history of "discriminatory
   provisions in US immigration law and policy," dating to the 19th
   century.[232][189] Notwithstanding the passage of anti-discrimination
   laws protecting non-citizens in and since 1965, the government has
   confirmed that "recent immigrants often encounter discrimination in
   employment, education, and housing as a result of persistent racism and
   xenophobia."[233][190] According to the United States, discrimination
   against non-citizens has not meaningfully abated or diminished since it
   became a party to ICERD; indeed, in its combined fourth, fifth, and
   sixth periodic reports, the United States noted an "increase in bias
   crimes and related discriminatory actions against persons perceived to
   be Muslim, or of Arab, Middle Eastern, or South Asian
   descent."[234][191] In its most recent report, the United States
   highlighted an additional threat from violent domestic extremists
   driven by "long-standing racial and ethnic tension, including
   opposition to immigration."[235][192]

   The CERD has made a series of recommendations about how the United
   States should more effectively protect non-citizens from
   discrimination. In 2014, the Committee called on the United States to
   ensure that the rights of non-citizens, "are fully guaranteed in law
   and in practice," including by "abolishing `Operation Streamline' [a
   program of mass criminal prosecution of migrants for unauthorized entry
   and reentry] and dealing with any breaches of immigration law through
   [a] civil, rather than criminal immigration system"; undertaking
   "thorough and individualized assessment concerning detention and
   deportation and guaranteeing access to legal representation in all
   immigration-related matters";[236][193] reviewing "laws and regulations
   in order to protect migrant workers from exploitative and abusive
   working conditions"; and ratifying several International Labor
   Organization conventions.[237][194] As set out below, the US has failed
   to implement these recommendations and has both failed to protect
   migrants from prohibited discrimination and actively contributed to
   worsening of the discriminatory situation since last undergoing CERD
   review.

   Multiple United States federal district courts have recently deemed the
   racist, xenophobic history of the US criminal reentry statute (one of
   two laws used in Operation Streamline) as relevant in analyzing the
   statute's application; one judge dismissed criminal charges based on a
   finding that the law was originally "enacted with discriminatory
   purpose"-indeed, would not have been enacted absent racial animus-and
   "has a disparate impact on Latinx persons."[238][195] Despite the
   CERD's recommendation that the US regulate migration exclusively as a
   civil and not a criminal matter, the United States continues to
   prosecute criminal entry and reentry crimes under these laws.[239][196]

   Naked xenophobia has been a major factor in US immigration policy since
   the last CERD review of the United States. Most significantly, former
   President Donald Trump actively promoted discrimination against
   migrants through a range of changes to US immigration law and policy, a
   number of which President Biden continues to enforce.[240][197] Ongoing
   and increased discriminatory treatment of non-citizens have taken the
   form of efforts to restrict access to the United States; disparate
   treatment of migrants in the custody of US immigration authorities and
   in conferring immigration benefits; and the mistreatment of
   non-citizens by US state and local governmental authorities.

   Workplace protections under international human rights law apply to all
   workers, regardless of citizenship status. However, fear of
   retaliation, including deportation, causes many workers who are
   unauthorized, who have family members who are undocumented, or
   otherwise have tentative immigration status to hesitate to speak up in
   the workplace or report abusive employers and working
   conditions.[241][198] These fears therefore have a massive impact on
   Black and brown workers' rights to fair pay and decent work conditions
   to the right to organize.

To address racial discrimination against migrants, the US should:

     * Conduct a thorough review of all current immigration laws to
       determine racial or discriminatory motivations or effects. Repeal
       or reform immigration laws enacted to effectuate racial animus or
       those with a racially discriminatory impact.[242][199]
     * Establish a mechanism providing full and effective reparation,
       proportional to the gravity of the violation and the harm suffered,
       to those who were subjected to discriminatory expulsion, family
       separation, prosecution and imprisonment, arbitrary detention,
       detention in inhumane conditions or other rights violations as a
       result of the racially discriminatory impact of US immigration
       laws.

Restrictions on Entry and Access to Territory

   In the reporting period there have been three particularly significant
   policies imposing discriminatory restrictions on entry and access to
   territory. First, the "discriminatory bans" (often called the "Muslim
   bans") on entry to the United States that first targeted "primarily
   Muslim countries"[243][200] and then "African countries."[244][201] In
   January 2021, the United States officially acknowledged that there were
   "discriminatory bans" on entry to the United States, which had been
   implemented by former President Trump and rescinded by President Biden.
   Commentators have pointed to the way in which anti-Muslim animus long
   operated as a form of racial discrimination in the US immigration
   system, prior to these bans on entry.[245][202] While the current
   administration rescinded the "discriminatory bans," the administration
   has failed to adequately remedy past discriminatory exclusions
   implemented under the policy and the ongoing consequences of the
   discriminatory order for migrants currently seeking to enter the
   US.[246][203]

   Second, the "migrant protection protocols" (MPP) (also known as "Remain
   in Mexico") policy forces migrants and asylum-seekers attempting to
   enter the United States at the US-Mexico land border to remain outside
   the US until an administrative proceeding is held to consider their
   status.[247][204] This results in harm in Mexico, heightened risk of
   refoulement to the country of origin and inadequate access to
   administrative proceedings including asylum hearings (in fact, in many
   instances, rulings by US immigration authorities occur in absentia,
   resulting in a denial of due process rights).[248][205] The MPP mostly
   affects those nationalities that Mexico refused to permit the US to
   expel under Title 42 (see below), including Central Americans, Cubans,
   Ecuadorians, and Venezuelans. Additionally, human rights reporting has
   established that migrants subjected to this policy face discriminatory
   treatment in Mexico.[249][206] This includes, for example, indigenous
   migrants who do not speak Spanish as their primary language and face
   mistreatment in Mexico.[250][207] While the Biden administration
   attempted to end this policy, a lawsuit brought by conservative
   governors in Texas and Mississippi forced the administration to
   reinstate it.[251][208] On June 30, 2022, the US Supreme Court-which
   did not review how the program exposed migrants to discrimination-held
   that the Biden Administration is able to end the program.[252][209]

   The third discriminatory policy involves the expulsion of
   asylum-seekers who approach the southern land border under a dated
   public health directive codified at Title 42 of the US Code. Title 42,
   when applied in this manner, conflicts with the right to seek asylum
   set out in Title 8; nonetheless the government continues to use this
   public health law to expel asylum-seekers.[253][210] The United States
   has carried out over 1.2 million expulsions under Title 42, a practice
   that has disproportionately impacted Black, Indigenous, and Latinx
   asylum-seekers, particularly from Central America, Africa, and Haiti as
   these migrants typically cannot access visas to enter the US via air
   travel).[254][211] In one high-profile instance, after a large number
   of Haitian asylum-seekers arrived in Del Rio, Texas in September 2021,
   the Biden administration sent a series of Title 42 expulsion flights to
   Haiti, exposing well over 10,000 asylum-seekers to conditions the US
   government previously recognized as being too dangerous and precarious
   for safe return.[255][212] In 2021, CBP officers were videotaped
   whipping Haitian asylum-seekers from horseback.[256][213] The use of
   Title 42 denies vast numbers of asylum-seekers arriving at the border
   the opportunity to demonstrate their claim of persecution and/or
   challenge their refoulement.[257][214] Title 42 expulsions stand in
   stark contrast to the actions the Biden administration has taken to
   grant exemptions to the application of Title 42 for the (primarily
   white) people fleeing from Ukraine.[258][215] Aspects of Title 42 are
   being litigated in various cases and the US Court of Appeals for the
   District of Columbia Circuit has held that aspects of the policy are
   likely unlawful, although not on the basis of disparate or
   discriminatory impact.[259][216]

To address discriminatory restrictions on entry and access to territory, the
US should:

     * Ensure non-discriminatory access to US territory and to individual
       status determination procedures run by US officials with
       trauma-informed training in US asylum law and whose mission is
       humanitarian and not focused on border security.
     * Repeal and replace orders, statutes, and regulations that have been
       used to exclude and/or expel migrants and asylum-seekers in a
       discriminatory manner.
     * Publicly track and report data demonstrating the effect of border
       policies by race and ethnicity.

Border Enforcement, Detention, and the Granting of Immigration Benefits

   In addition to border policies seeking to prevent migrants and
   asylum-seekers from ever setting foot in the United States, US
   immigration enforcement at the border and in the interior of the US has
   a disparate impact on the basis of race. This is caused in part by the
   failure of US constitutional interpretation to prohibit racial
   profiling in immigration enforcement and the continued reliance on
   racial profiling in border and national security enforcement.[260][217]
   It is also the product of the intersection between structural
   discrimination in the US criminal legal system and deportation law. One
   recent study, reviewing over 13,000 stops by law enforcement officials
   in the US State of Michigan, found clear evidence that CBP uses "racial
   profiling to target immigrants from Latin America and other people of
   color."[261][218] As Arnulfo Gomez described in relation to one such
   stop, "there was no reason for us to have been pulled over just because
   of the color of our skin. Everything that happened to us was wrong. We
   were being targeted just because we are Hispanic."[262][219]

   Another recent study found that Black immigrants are more likely to be
   detained in connection with criminal convictions than the immigration
   population overall and ultimately more likely to be removed due to a
   criminal conviction, often despite having lived in the United States
   for long periods and having strong community ties.[263][220] Evidence
   demonstrates that the United States consistently returns Black and
   Latinx migrants to countries where they are at risk.[264][221]

   Once apprehended, asylum-seekers and other migrants are subjected to
   prolonged and arbitrary immigration detention, often in abusive
   conditions and without adequate health care. Most migrants are also
   forced to navigate civil proceedings related to their status without
   legal representation. The United States operates the largest
   immigration detention system in the world. On a given day, tens of
   thousands of immigrants are detained on the basis of their status as a
   migrant.[265][222] US law mandates detention in many cases.[266][223]
   Myriad reports have documented the abysmal conditions to which
   immigration detainees are subjected.[267][224] Many detention
   facilities are operated by private corporations under contracts with
   the US government; approximately [268]80 percent of immigrant detainees
   are held in detention facilities owned or operated by private prison
   companies.[269][225] Research has shown that failures by ICE aggravated
   the risk of Covid-19 infections and that ICE transfers of detainees
   without prior testing effectively amplified contagion.[270][226]
   Detainees who have protested unsafe living conditions, including
   through the use of hunger strikes, have been subjected to retaliation,
   violence, and involuntary medical procedures, including force feeding
   and forced urinary catheterization.[271][227] While the US does not
   adequately make available relevant data disaggregated by race or
   ethnicity, Black and brown migrants are disparately impacted by the
   harms of immigration detention. While [272]Black immigrants make up
   only 4.8% of detained immigrants facing deportation before the
   Executive Office for Immigration Review (EOIR), they make up 17.4% of
   detained immigrants facing deportation before the EOIR on criminal
   grounds.[273][228] Data shows that ICE disproportionately places Black
   migrants in solitary confinement and subjects them to
   disproportionately long periods in detention.[274][229]

   The US represented to CERD that it had made changes in response to the
   Committee's 2014 recommendations regarding legal counsel and
   individualized status assessments, noting that ICE hired a "Legal
   Access Coordinator" who seeks to "enhance detained individuals' access"
   to legal counsel.[275][230] The US, however, continues to constrain
   access to legal counsel for detained migrants, requiring them to
   "secure legal representation at their own expense, find pro bono
   representation," or navigate the system alone.[276][231] Moreover, a
   [277]recent report found that ICE systematically restricts the most
   basic modes of communication, such as in-person legal visits,
   telephones, and legal mail, that detained people need to use to connect
   with legal counsel.[278][232] The vast majority of detained immigrants
   are without counsel.[279][233] This is problematic not only because
   those detained are disproportionately Black and brown, but also because
   detained immigrants who have lawyers obtain relief from removal at a
   rate of more than ten times higher than those who do not.[280][234]
   Calls for universal representation have pointed out that provision of
   counsel can help eliminate bias and discrimination in the allocation of
   legal services.[281][235]

   ICERD's mandate that States Parties "take effective measures" to ensure
   that their policies accord with the treaty cannot be accomplished
   without accurate data. Unfortunately, the US government does not
   publish or collect adequate data about border deaths, distress calls,
   and other border enforcement actions, nor about immigration
   enforcement, detention, use of force incidents, removals, or DHS civil
   rights and civil liberties complaints or investigations. Such
   information should be collected and disaggregated by race, ethnicity,
   nationality, immigration status, gender, age, disability, and other
   criteria.

To address discrimination in border and immigration enforcement, the US
should:

     * Revise guidance on the use of racial profiling by federal law
       enforcement to eliminate the existing border and national security
       loopholes and prohibit discrimination based on actual or perceived
       race, ethnicity, religion, nationality, and English proficiency.
     * Gradually abolish immigration detention.
     * Repeal laws mandating detention and invest in community-based
       social services as alternatives to detention without furthering
       surveillance of immigrants as an alternative to detention.
     * Establish, by statute or regulation, binding minimum standards for
       conditions of detention.
     * Establish, by statute or regulation, access to government-provided
       counsel for all migrants in proceedings regarding their status as a
       migrant, and ensure timely and confidential access to in-person,
       telephone, and video conferencing as well as legal mail in
       detention.
     * Publicly track and report data demonstrating the effect of
       immigration enforcement and benefits policies by race, ethnicity,
       and other disaggregated bases.
     * Prioritize and facilitate country visits by the UN Special
       Rapporteur on the human rights of migrants and provide unimpeded
       access to all places of detention.

Actions by State and Local Governments

   Currently, one of the most high-profile areas of concern is immigration
   enforcement by certain US state and local governments.[282][236] In
   Texas, for example, the state governor claimed that the state is under
   threat from migrants "from countries you haven't even heard of before"
   and has repeatedly used the rhetoric of "invasion."[283][237] The
   state's Operation Lone Star, just one part of anti-immigrant actions
   taken by the state, has aggressively used selective enforcement of the
   misdemeanor offense of criminal trespass to justify the arrest and
   detention of thousands of alleged migrants in a newly created
   segregated criminal legal system with separate dockets, public defender
   assignments, jails, and booking facilities.[284][238] As of March 2022,
   Texas had deployed state troopers and mass-mobilized members of the
   National Guard, who made at least 208,000 arrests.[285][239] Affidavits
   of arresting officers reveal that arrests are based on racial and
   national origin profiling, repeatedly describing those arrested as
   "Hispanic" and "undocumented."[286][240] These criminal proceedings
   have resulted in prolonged detention in egregious conditions; many
   cases have been dismissed for lack of probable cause.[287][241] Most
   recently, in an aggressive escalation of these policies, the state of
   Texas announced it would [288]return those suspected of being migrants
   to the border, raising a host of legal concerns.[289][242]

To address racial discrimination at the border, US jurisdictions should:

     * Expand the federal investigation into discriminatory treatment of
       non-citizens under Operation Lone Star to encompass Texas' new EO
       authorizing state law enforcement officials target, arrest, and
       detain suspected migrants and transport them to the US-Mexico
       border.
     * Issue guidance from DHS to its components affirming a policy of
       non-cooperation between DHS and the Operation Lone Star trespass
       arrest program.
     * Take all measures, including litigation, to compel Texas to end
       Operation Lone Star and other discriminatory abuse of migrants.
     * Immediately end federal funding for the agencies and counties
       engaged in the abusive Operation Lone Star border initiative, even
       as the Justice Department conducts an inquiry into the operation.

Racial Discrimination in Public Services and Social Protection

   Article 5 of ICERD provides that "States Parties undertake to prohibit
   and to eliminate racial discrimination in all its forms and to
   guarantee the right of everyone" to economic and social rights,
   including protection against unemployment, the right to medical care,
   social security, social services, and education, and just conditions of
   work and equal pay for equal work. Article 2 of ICERD further requires
   concrete state action to eliminate disparities in economic rights.
   However, racial minorities in the United States continue to suffer a
   lack of economic security compared to their white counterparts.

   The median wealth of white households in the United States is
   significantly higher than that of Black, Indigenous, or Latinx
   households. This so-called racial wealth gap[290][243] has grown since
   the country ratified ICERD, and the median wealth of white households
   is now at least ten-times that of the median Black household.[291][244]
   A disproportionate share of people who are Black, Indigenous, Latinx,
   or immigrants live under the poverty line. The poverty rates of Black
   and Latinx people are twice as high than among white people.[292][245]

   US Census Bureau data from[293][246] September 2021 found that some 19
   million adults lived in households with insufficient food and 11.9
   million adults were behind on rent.[294][247] According to data from
   the US Department of Agriculture, 19.1% of Black households and 15.6%
   of Hispanic households experienced food insecurity in 2019, compared to
   7.9% of white Americans.[295][248]

   The Covid-19 pandemic has only deepened these sharp disparities. The
   impacts of the pandemic and the economic fallout have been widespread,
   but remain particularly prevalent among Blacks, Latinx, and other
   people of color.[296][249] Gaps in preparedness and response to the
   Covid-19 pandemic have disproportionately negatively burdened people of
   color,[297][250] which has deepened existing racial injustices in
   health care,[298][251] housing,[299][252] employment,[300][253]
   education,[301][254] and wealth accumulation.[302][255]

   Over the course of the pandemic, poverty fell overall due in part to
   the stimulus checks and unemployment benefits received by
   many.[303][256] But the little progress made toward economic parity
   over the last year has stalled, as relief measures[304][257]
   implemented in response to Covid-19 have been reduced, ended, or struck
   down by the courts. Today, the Black-white wealth gap[305][258] is as
   big as it was in 1968.[306][259]

   While the US has acknowledged these disparities, it has admitted to
   CERD that it has failed to invest sufficient resources to address them,
   leading to the persistence of deeply discriminatory health care,
   inadequate social safety nets, and segregated communities and schools.

Public Health during the Covid-19 Pandemic

   Article 5 of ICERD provides that "States Parties undertake to prohibit
   and to eliminate racial discrimination in all its forms" in the right
   to "public health" and "medical care"[307][260] and provide equal
   access to healthcare services.[308][261] CERD has specifically mandated
   that states address the disproportionate impact of the Covid-19
   pandemic on racial minorities.[309][262] Where there are persistent
   disparities, ICERD requires states to affirmatively adopt measures to
   address them.

   The Committee has expressed concern over the failure of the US to
   address racial disparities in access to affordable health care, as many
   states have opted out of the Medicaid expansion program, excluding
   substantial numbers of racial minorities. In addition, the Committee
   expressed concern that many states have explicitly excluded migrants
   from health care.[310][263] In 2014, it recommended that the US "take
   concrete measures" to ensure individuals, "in particular racial and
   ethnic minorities who reside in states that have opted out of" the
   Affordable Care Act (ACA) and migrants have "access to affordable and
   adequate health-care services."[311][264] CERD has recommended that the
   US eliminate steep racial disparities in sexual and reproductive
   health, collect data, and improve monitoring and accountability
   systems.[312][265] In the context of the Covid-19 pandemic, CERD has
   made clear that States are obligated to "ensure equal access" to
   medical care.[313][266]

   Black, Latinx, and Indigenous communities continue to suffer profound
   disparities in rates of chronic health conditions, health outcomes, and
   access to quality health care.[314][267] For example, these communities
   are disproportionately impacted both by diabetes and its negative
   health outcomes, and are especially vulnerable to the harmful human
   rights impact of insulin prices in the US.[315][268] The Covid-19
   pandemic has deepened existing racial injustices in health
   care[316][269]: minorities are more likely to suffer severe illness and
   die from Covid-19[317][270] and face barriers to vaccine
   access.[318][271]

   Black people suffer from particularly acute racial disparities in
   maternal mortality and cervical cancer rates.[319][272] The maternal
   mortality rate for Black women is three times higher than white women
   and rose further between 2019 and 2020, driven by significant increases
   in the maternal mortality rate of Black and Latinx women.[320][273]
   These deaths, and those from cervical cancer, are preventable. Indeed,
   in 2020, 194 countries committed to eliminating cervical cancer
   globally.[321][274] In the US, Black women are more likely than white
   women to have never been screened for cervical cancer, are diagnosed at
   a later stage, and have lower survival rates.[322][275] In the state of
   Alabama, Black women are nearly twice as likely to die of cervical
   cancer as white women.[323][276]

   Given this crisis in maternal mortality and access to care for people
   of color, the Supreme Court's recent decision in Dobbs v. Jackson
   Women's Health Organization to overturn the constitutional right to
   access an abortion in Roe v. Wade and related decisions will have a
   [324]particularly profound and deadly impact on people of
   color.[325][277] Black people have [326]higher-risk pregnancies, are
   more than four times as likely to have had abortions as white pregnant
   people, are more likely to miscarry or have stillbirths compared to
   white pregnant people,[327][278] and are more likely to live in states
   that restrict abortions.[328][279]

   Migrants also suffer from acute health disparities, and some have no
   access to health care at all. Although some local policies provide
   undocumented immigrants with health care,[329][280] the federal
   government continues to prevent undocumented and some legal immigrants
   from enrolling in ACA coverage and Medicaid.[330][281] The lack of
   access to adequate health care has exacerbated the effects of Covid-19
   for immigrants, particularly undocumented populations in frontline
   jobs.[331][282]

   State and federal prisons have failed to offer adequate health
   protection generally, and specifically against Covid-19. Covid-19
   incidence and mortality rates were consistently higher among the prison
   population than the overall US population in the first year of the
   pandemic, and the cumulative toll of Covid-19 has been several times
   greater among the prison population than the overall US
   population.[332][283] The US's response continues to be inadequate; in
   immigration detention centers, COVID-19 infections have increased by
   more than[333] 940 percent since January 2022, while ICE has only
   administered booster shots to 671 of the 22,000 people in ICE
   detention.[334][284] Given the rapid spread of the virus behind bars,
   and the racially disproportionate prison population, Black and Latinx
   people have been particularly vulnerable.[335][285] By May 2020, Black
   people accounted for 60% of Covid-19 deaths in the New York State
   prison system, despite comprising 48% of detainees.[336][286]

To eliminate racial disparities in public health, the US should:

     * Improve the affordability and availability of health insurance for
       low- and middle-income earners. In particular, consider legislation
       to expand coverage for existing social protection programs like
       Medicaid and Medicare. In the absence of such legislation, Congress
       should take appropriate short-term remedial measures.
     * Support community health workers and community-based approaches to
       reproductive health care that address healthcare access and the
       social determinants of health.
     * Establish inclusivity policies that: support linguistic and racial
       diversity, including in federally qualified health clinics; and
       acknowledge, confront, and seek to remedy historic and current
       experiences of racial discrimination in public health, including by
       creating an official, confidential, and accessible complaint
       mechanism for patients who use federally qualified health
       facilities.

Inadequate Social Safety Net

   ICERD requires states to guarantee the rights to social security and
   social services without distinction as to race,[337][287] and the
   Committee has made clear that States are obligated to eliminate all
   forms of racial inequities, whether intentional or not.[338][288]
   Despite these protections, Black and Latinx people continue to face
   underinvestment in social protection, which has contributed to profound
   disparities in poverty and economic security. While, in the past,
   America's public benefits system helped reduce and prevent poverty and
   racial disparities by providing basic economic, food, childcare, and
   housing support, thereby preventing the intergenerational transmission
   of poverty, it has weakened substantially over the past
   decades.[339][289]

   The inadequate support system has been driven by racial
   animus,[340][290] community violence,[341][291] and discriminatory
   government policies based on racist stereotypes[342][292] as well as
   federal delegation to states.[343][293] Although most safety net
   programs are federally funded, state control over program design,
   rules, and benefit levels has resulted in inconsistent protection and
   racial inequalities. Similar to problematic aspects of the Medicaid
   provision,[344][294] US regions with larger populations of color have
   weaker safety nets and higher rates of economic hardship.[345][295] For
   example, workers of color have higher unemployment rates and also are
   more likely to reside in states with weaker unemployment insurance
   systems and other safety net programs.[346][296]

   The Covid-19 pandemic exacerbated the economic disparities and
   underlying conditions driving these inequalities, as Black and Latinx
   communities have experienced more job losses (and ensuing loss of
   health insurance), higher rates of infection and mortality, and greater
   likelihood of evictions and hunger than their white
   counterparts.[347][297] Similarly, women are disproportionately
   impacted by the economic fallout of Covid-19[348][298] For example,
   40.8 percent of Black, non-Hispanic women and 44.6 percent of Latinas
   faced housing insecurity in mid-July 2020 compared to 15.4 percent of
   white, non-Hispanic men. These rates were higher for households with
   children (45.2 percent for Black, non-Hispanic women with children and
   48.8 percent for Latinas with children). In addition, in April 2020,
   less than half of the adult Black population was employed and the Black
   and white unemployment gap widened to 5.3 percentage points.[349][299]
   Only 36 percent of households earning under $50,000 that lost jobs
   received unemployment benefits.[350][300] Women, especially women of
   color, have disproportionately suffered from pandemic job
   losses.[351][301] As of late 2020, Black women's employment fell 18.2
   percent from its peak compared with 16.7 percent for white women. In
   September 2020, white women's employment recovered while Black women's
   employment remained low. Latina women have also experienced dramatic
   employment and labor force declines.

   Although the US issued stimulus checks and other relief, these measures
   could not repair the social safety net shredded by decades of budget
   cuts and draconian rules.[352][302] In addition, there were racial
   disparities in the provision of the Coronavirus Aid Relief, and
   Economic Security (CARES) Act economic impact payments.[353][303]
   Undocumented immigrants were also largely left without relief during
   the pandemic as they and other immigrants were ineligible for
   pandemic-related stimulus checks, temporary family assistance (TANF),
   and food stamps.[354][304] Many immigrants eligible for unemployment
   relief were effectively denied relief because many states failed to
   translate application forms and other essential documents.[355][305]
   Child poverty increased by 41 percent within a month after the US let
   its expanded child tax credit expire at the end of 2021, pushing 3.7
   million more children into poverty. Black and Latinx children
   experienced the highest percentage point increases in poverty, 5.9
   percent and 7.1 percent respectively.[356][306]

   Without effective social safety nets, families are also at risk of
   lengthy separation. Nationally, more than 75 percent of child welfare
   cases involve neglect, which occurs when a parent or caregiver fails to
   provide adequate food, clothing, shelter, or supervision to a
   child.[357][307] Instead of assisting families by providing cash, food,
   housing, or childcare assistance, the US child welfare system uses
   indicators of poverty as bases for removing children from
   families^while subsidizing and incentivizing foster care and adoption
   under the pretext of acting in the child's best interest. Due to
   systemic racism and other factors, this disproportionately impacts
   families of color.

To eliminate racial discrimination in the social safety net, the US should:

     * Increase benefit levels for social assistance and social insurance
       programs, including cash or in-kind assistance, including relevant
       tax credits like the Earned Income Tax Credit and Child Tax Credit,
       to ensure benefit adequacy, and consider adopting a universal
       income security program, such as a universal basic income.
     * Create federal standards optimizing eligibility for safety net
       programs. Where existing means-tested social assistance and
       insurance programs are not expanded universally, improve their
       eligibility requirements and accessibility. Means-tested programs
       should not include eligibility requirements that can unfairly
       exclude those in need, such as strict asset tests, or certain
       behavioral requirements like drug tests or work requirements.
     * Review and amend the current models used to create the annual
       Federal Poverty Guidelines to ensure that they are effectively
       capturing populations facing poverty.
     * Eliminate all benefit eligibility criteria for social protection
       programs tied to immigration status or criminal history.
     * Desist from using indicators of poverty as a basis for child
       removals, prolonged family separation, and termination of parental
       rights.
     * Create a federally funded system for paid family and medical leave.
     * Enforce Title VI of the Civil Rights Act against agencies that do
       not provide language access services or discriminate in the
       provision of benefits to minorities.

US Education Policy

   Article 2(2) of ICERD provides that States Parties shall take "special
   and concrete measures to ensure the adequate development and protection
   of certain racial groups ... , for the purpose of guaranteeing them the
   full and equal enjoyment of human rights and fundamental
   freedoms."[358][308] Quality education is central to the enjoyment of
   basic rights such as job procurement and political
   participation.[359][309] The CERD has underscored that barriers in
   education "results in the transmission of poverty from generation to
   generation" for people of African descent.[360][310]

   Discrimination and segregation in the education sector remain rampant
   across the US, driving inequality in education and in life
   opportunities.[361][311] Although the population is increasingly
   diverse, racial segregation in US schools is higher now than it has
   been in decades.[362][312] Majority-minority schools continue to be
   underfunded and fail to provide adequate educational opportunities to
   minority students.[363][313] US schools are primarily funded by
   neighborhood-specific property taxes, meaning that schools in poorer
   neighborhoods generate and receive less funding and resources than
   those in wealthier neighborhoods with higher property values.[364][314]
   Racial disparities in education's connection to US property tax
   policies built in part on racial discrimination, racial segregation,
   and the legacies of slavery has been widely recognized, including by
   some US courts.[365][315] Poor conditions in these schools-such as
   "missing or unqualified teachers, physically dangerous facilities, and
   inadequate books and materials"-correlate with lower student
   performance and low literacy rates, hampering minority individuals'
   ability to participate equally in democratic society.[366][316]

   In its 2008 and 2014 concluding observations addressed to the US, the
   CERD expressed concern about racial segregation in public schools,
   finding that prohibition of the use of race-conscious measures as a
   tool to promote integration inhibited progress.[367][317] The Committee
   found that students from racial and ethnic minorities attend segregated
   schools with unequal facilities, noting that even when students of
   color attend racially diverse schools, they are often relegated to
   "single race" classes, denied access to advanced courses, and unfairly
   disciplined.[368][318]^The Committee recommended that the US undertake
   a study to examine the reasons underlying de facto racial segregation,
   and "adopt all appropriate measures" to reduce the achievement gap
   between white and Black students "by improving the quality of education
   provided to [Black] students."[369][319] In 2014, the Committee
   [370]recommended that the US intensify its efforts to ensure equal
   access to education by taking measures including developing a concrete
   plan with goals and timelines to address racial segregation in schools
   and neighborhoods, and increasing federal funding for programs
   promoting racially integrated learning environments for
   students.[371][320]

   In its 2021 report to the CERD, the US made a number of claims
   regarding its efforts to promote diversity and equal opportunity in
   education,[372][321] including 2021 American Rescue Plan's
   funding[373][322] and other legislation,[374][323] as well as efforts
   by the Justice Department Civil Rights Division[375][324] and the
   Department of Education (DOE).[376][325] Nonetheless, the racial
   disparities in educational opportunities among students resulting from
   ongoing ICERD violations remain persistently and disturbingly high.

   The CERD has recommended that measures be taken to reduce the school
   dropout and suspension rates for children of African descent.[377][326]
   In its 2008 concluding observations, the Committee highlighted racial
   disparities in suspension and expulsion rates as exacerbating high
   dropout rates, as well as high rates of referrals of minority youth to
   the justice system.[378][327] The Committee expressed particular
   concern about school districts' use of "zero tolerance" school
   discipline policies and recommended that districts review these
   policies and seriously consider limiting suspensions and expulsions to
   the most serious cases of school misconduct, and recommended special
   training for school officers.[379][328]

   Nevertheless, disproportionate numbers of students of color continue to
   enter the criminal legal system. Schools with high populations of
   racial minority students have higher rates of suspension and expulsion,
   and students of color are more likely to be arrested as
   adults.[380][329] In addition, students of color face discriminatory
   [381]discipline and [382]criminalization.[383][330] Black students are
   [384]punished more frequently and harshly in all categories of school
   discipline, even though many schools have removed the term "zero
   tolerance" from their policies, driven in part by differential
   treatment and support at school by race.[385][331] A June 2021 report
   from the US Department of Education found that Black students are
   removed from school by being suspended or expelled (long term removal),
   and are referred to law enforcement at rates that are [386]more than
   twice their share of enrollment.[387][332] Students of color are more
   likely to go to a school with a law enforcement officer, more likely to
   be referred to law enforcement, and more likely to be arrested at
   school.[388][333]^In addition, students who attend schools with high
   percentages of Black students and students from low-income families are
   more likely face security measures like metal detectors, random
   "contraband" sweeps, security guards, and security cameras, even when
   controlling for the level of misconduct in schools or violence in
   school neighborhoods.[389][334]

   Article 7 of ICERD requires states to adopt immediate and effective
   measures, specifically in teaching, education, culture, and
   information, to promote tolerance and combat prejudice against
   national, racial, and ethnic groups. To combat prejudice and
   intolerance, the CERD has urged States to develop campaigns to educate
   the public about the history and culture of people of African descent
   and the importance of building an inclusive society.[390][335] The
   Committee has also urged affirmative efforts to ensure that textbooks
   contain "chapters about the history and cultures of peoples of African
   descent," and to "encourage and support the publication and
   distribution of books and other print materials, as well as the
   broadcasting of television and radio programs about their history and
   cultures."[391][336]^

   The US has [392]failed to implement these recommendations.[393][337]
   There are [394]no federal requirements or standards for teaching the
   history or racial discrimination in the US or about the history and
   cultures of Black Americans and other people of color, and only a
   handful of states mandate that such history be taught.[395][338] Even
   where mandates exist, each US state may teach in a way that leads to
   historical inaccuracies.[396][339] In the absence of any federal
   mandate, multiple states have introduced and enacted laws prohibiting
   schools from teaching about the reality of racism by banning "divisive
   concepts relating to race, racism and other topics."[397][340] Learning
   Black history is beneficial to all students: While enhancing the
   self-esteem of Black students, it conveys historical realities to all
   students and encourages empathy, understanding, and efforts to avoid
   repeating the racist violence of the past.[398][341] Further, denying
   the historical and contemporary realities of racial discrimination
   impedes not only justice and accountability for historic wrongs, but
   the eradication of persisting structures of racial inequality that is
   the core purpose of ICERD.

To address discrimination in the US education system, the US should:

     * Invest in underfunded schools to equalize public school funding
       throughout the US and continue to provide increased supplemental
       nutrition benefits for families with children during summer months
       when free or reduced-price school meals are not available.
     * Expand access to free, quality pre-primary education.
     * Expand the benefits of Pell Grants for low- and middle-income
       tertiary education students.
     * Adopt a federal national standard mandating the teaching of the
       colonization, including   forced displacement, dispossession, and
       mass killings of Indigenous peoples; the history of slavery, Jim
       Crow laws, lynchings, redlining, and segregation; civil rights
       movements; and other racial justice civil and labor rights
       movements.
     * The Justice Department and Education Department should enforce
       Title VI and relevant statutes to ensure non-discrimination in the
       implementation of such a national standard, and in particular,
       prohibit school districts or states from banning Critical Race
       Theory or from teaching about other forms of racial discrimination.

   [594][175] In jurisdictions where S-Comm is authorized, "any time an
   individual is arrested and booked into local jail for any reason, his
   or her fingerprints are electronically run through ICE's immigration
   database." The program causes "widespread unlawful detention without
   criminal charges or a hearing" by targeting immigrants at the time of
   arrest, not conviction and it "ensnares huge numbers of low-level
   offenders and non-criminals," fueling mass deportations. "Secure
   Communities ("S-Comm")," American Civil Liberties Union, undated,

   [595][176] The 287(g) program allows "state and local agencies to act
   as immigration enforcement agents" through agreements with ICE. The
   agreements are designed to "extend the reach" of deportation procedures
   by "getting localities to do ICE's work at their own expense," and has
   led to "racial profiling, civil rights violations, isolation of
   immigrant communities, and family separation." "National Map of 287(g)

   and 2014, respectively, and that [599]CBP "redesigned its basic

   provide training on proper techniques and tactics, and mandate
   de-escalation training. Ibid., para. 79.

   [600][178] These instances included a CBP officer, in 2018, hitting an
   asylum applicant so hard he was "knocked unconscious and suffered brain

   Torture, which provides authoritative interpretation of the CAT, is
   [637]clear that the duty not to return applies "equally" in cases where
   a government "is unable to prevent" acts of severe abuse committed by
   nonstate actors. Moreover, Haitians, Nicaraguans, Mexicans, and other
   asylum-seekers expelled by the United States to their home countries
   under Title 42 have consistently reported that they have been denied
   the opportunity to raise their fears of persecution or torture prior to
   their return. There is overwhelming evidence that the United States is
   failing to provide even the unduly restrictive so-called "shout test"
   to migrants under Title 42 (i.e., a chance for a referral if a migrant
   makes a "spontaneous and reasonably believable claim" that they fear
   being tortured). As of November 2021, only 3,217 migrants were referred
   for screening out of 1,163,000 border expulsions under Title 42 since
   March 2020; and of these, only 272 passed their initial screening

   [642][214] Former US State Department Legal Advisor Harold Koh pointed
   out that the US applies Title 42 to individuals "to whom our legal
   obligations under the Refugee treaties and parallel statutes have
   undeniably attached," but provides no affirmative screening for an
   individual's fear of persecution. That omission "inevitably create[s]
   an unacceptably high risk that a great many people deserving of asylum
   will instead likely be returned to countries where they fear
   persecution, death, or torture." The Title 42 policies thus "violate
   our legal obligation not to expel or return ("refouler") individuals"--
   "especially migrants fleeing from Haiti." Letter from Harold Koh, Legal
