   Africa in focus on International Day of Racial Discrimination Elimination

   The International Day for the Elimination of Racial Discrimination is
   observed annually on 21 March.

   By Fr. Benedict Mayaki, SJ

   The International Day for the Elimination of Racial Discrimination
   is an observance instituted through an adopted United Nations (UN)
   General Assembly resolution passed in October 1966 with the aim of
   abolishing racial discrimination and other forms of segregation. It is
   also in honor of the struggle to end the policy of apartheid in South
   Africa.

   The International Convention on the Elimination of all forms of Racial
   Discrimination defines racial discrimination as “any distinction,
   exclusion, restriction or preference based on race, color, descent, or
   national or ethnic origin which has the purpose or effect of nullifying
   or impairing the recognition, enjoyment or exercise, on an equal
   footing, of human rights and fundamental freedoms in the political,
   economic, social, cultural or any other field of public life.”

Background

   On 21 March 1960, South African police opened fire and killed 69 people
   in the township of Sharpeville, near Johannesburg, during a protest
   against the apartheid “pass laws.” The pass laws required that
   indigenous Africans over the age of sixteen carry a passbook everywhere
   as a means of controlling their movement within restricted
   neighborhoods.

   Six years after, the UN General Assembly called upon the international
   community to eliminate apartheid and racial discrimination by
   proclaiming 21 March as the International Day for the Elimination of
   Racial Discrimination. It also called on its member states to initiate
   appropriate programs to combat racial discrimination and promote
   equality.

Focus on people of African descent

   This year, the United Nations is focusing its celebration on a midterm
   review of the International decade for people of African descent. A
   General Assembly resolution set aside 2015 - 2024 to focus on the
   descendants of the victims of the transatlantic slave trade and
   migrants of African ancestry as they constitute “some of the poorest
   and most marginalized groups.”

   The resolution notes that “People of African descent can suffer from
   multiple forms of discrimination based on age, sex, language, religion,
   political opinion, social origin, property, disability, birth, or other
   status.”

   The midterm review will be a means of providing a “solid framework to
   take effective measures to address these issues in the spirit of
   recognition, justice and development.” It will also facilitate “taking
   stock of the progress made and deciding on further necessary actions.”

The Church against racial discrimination

   The Church has always made her voice heard in her advocacy for
   equality, justice and tolerance.

   In September 2018, during an address to the participants of the World
   Conference on Xenophobia, Racism and Populist Nationalism in the
   Context of Global Migration, Pope Francis, lamenting the immorality of
   discrimination said:

   “We live in times in which feelings that to many had seemed to be
   outdated appear to be reemerging and spreading. Feelings of suspicion,
   fear, contempt and even hatred towards other individuals or groups
   judged to be different on the basis of their ethnicity, nationality or
   religion… These feelings, then, too often inspire real acts of
   intolerance, discrimination or exclusion that seriously harm the
   dignity of those involved as well as their fundamental rights,
   including the very right to life and to physical and moral integrity.”

   Calling for action, the Pope said: “The seriousness of these phenomena
   cannot leave us indifferent. We are all called, in our respective
   roles, to nurture and promote respect for the inherent dignity of every
   human person beginning with the family… but also in the various social
   contexts we engage in.”

   “The other is not only a being to be respected by virtue of his or her
   inherent dignity but above all a brother or sister to be loved.”
