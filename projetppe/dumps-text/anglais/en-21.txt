Paul F. deLespinasse: Are we combating discrimination the wrong way?
     __________________________________________________________________

   Racial discrimination is a major problem. But the approach we have
   taken to fix this problem is itself problematical.

   Slavery and segregation were created by legislation enforced by
   rigorous government sanctions. Legal reforms were obviously needed, and
   the first step was to eliminate this legislation.

   In his 1963 "Letter From A Birmingham Jail," Martin Luther King
   proclaimed that "An unjust law is a code that a majority inflicts on a
   minority that is not binding on itself. This is difference made
   legal."

   King was right, because genuine laws must be general rules of action,
   and rules applying only to people of one race are not general. A
   general rule must apply to anybody taking the prohibited action.

   A rule requiring only people of color to ride in the back of the bus is
   clearly not a general one. (And it would make no sense at all to
   require everybody to ride in the back of the bus. No matter to whom it
   is applied, this kind of rule is just plain crazy!)

   I differ from Dr. King only in that I don't concede that the unjust
   codes he referred to rise to the dignity of law at all. They are
   pseudolaws, not just bad laws.

   The pseudolaws supporting slavery and mandating racial segregation have
   been repealed or declared unconstitutional. But lingering social
   attitudes, institutional inertia and continued suffering of descendants
   of the former slaves called for further major reforms.

   Laws whose goal was to reduce or eliminate racial discrimination were
   an obvious and legitimate next step.

   A genuine civil rights law whose goal is to combat racial
   discrimination could have been a requirement that stores and other
   public facilities accept all would be customers first come, first
   served.

   The vital parts of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 dealing with open
   accommodations (in stores, restaurants, hotels, etc.) would have been
   even more effective if they had been, instead, first come, first served
   rules.

   But rather than imposing a first come, first served rule, civil rights
   legislation has tried to make make "discrimination" itself illegal. The
   problem is that discrimination is not an action. It can be a reason or
   motivation for an action, but it is not itself an action. And as I
   indicated already, law must be a rule of action.

   Under current legislation, the act of declining to hire a person of
   color is not illegal unless the reason for that decision is that the
   applicant is a person of color.

   The very same action in identical circumstances can thus be either
   legal or legal, depending on whether a judge, jury or bureaucrat thinks
   that the motive for the action was illegal. Since motives cannot be
   observed but must be inferred, or assumed, this gives officials
   tremendous discretionary power.

   By contrast, although the motive for violating a first come, first
   served rule would be legally irrelevant, such laws would prevent
   establishments from engaging in racial discrimination. Since
   discrimination is not an action, efforts to make it illegal are
   pseudolaws.

   Paradoxically, our efforts to eliminate racial discrimination have
   employed the same kind of illegitimate tools that created slavery and
   racial segregation.

   Formerly, individuals and organizations wishing to enter into voluntary
   associations with people of another race were "legally" prevented from
   doing so. This is what segregation did.

   We now try to force people of different races to enter into
   associations with each other whether they prefer to do so or not. These
   associations are hardly voluntary ones, since voluntary associations
   can only be created by mutual consent to associate.

   We should try a third approach: respecting freedom of voluntary
   association except when limits on this freedom are imposed by genuine
   laws.
