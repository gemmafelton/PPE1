The Harsh Reality of Life Under Apartheid in South Africa

   For decades, the country's Black majority was controlled by racist laws
   enshrining white supremacy.

   From 1948 through the 1990s, a single word dominated life in South
   Africa. Apartheid—Afrikaans for “apartness”—kept the country’s majority
   Black population under the thumb of a small white minority. It would
   take decades of struggle to stop the policy, which affected every facet
   of life in a country locked in centuries-old patterns of discrimination
   and racism.

   The segregation began in 1948 after the National Party came to power.
   The nationalist political party instituted policies of white supremacy,
   which empowered white South Africans who descended from both Dutch and
   British settlers in South Africa while further disenfranchising Black
   Africans.

   The system was rooted in the country’s history of colonization and
   slavery. White settlers had historically viewed Black South Africans as
   a natural resource to be used to turn the country from a rural society
   to an industrialized one. Starting in the 17th century, Dutch settlers
   relied on slaves to build up South Africa. Around the time that slavery
   was abolished in the country in 1863, gold and diamonds were discovered
   in South Africa.

   Many white women in South Africa learned how to use firearms for
   self-protection in the event of racial unrest in 1961, when South
   Africa became a republic.

   That discovery represented a lucrative opportunity for white-owned
   mining companies that employed—and exploited—Black workers. Those
   companies all but enslaved Black miners while enjoying massive wealth
   from the diamonds and gold they mined. Like Dutch slave holders, they
   relied on intimidation and discrimination to rule over their Black
   workers.

   The mining companies borrowed a tactic that earlier slaveholders and
   British settlers had used to control Black workers: pass laws. As early
   as the 18th century, these laws had required members of the Black
   majority, and other people of color, to carry identification papers at
   all times and restricted their movement in certain areas. They were
   also used to control Black settlement, forcing Black people to reside
   in places where their labor would benefit white settlers.

   Those laws persisted through the 20th century as South Africa became a
   self-governing dominion of the United Kingdom. Between 1899 and 1902,
   Britain and the Dutch-descended Afrikaners fought one another in the
   Boer War, a conflict that the Afrikaners eventually lost. Anti-British
   sentiment continued to foment among white South Africans, and Afrikaner
   nationalists developed an identity rooted in white supremacy. When they
   took control in 1948, they made the country’s already discriminatory
   laws even more draconian.

   Racist fears and attitudes about “natives” colored white society.
   Though apartheid was supposedly designed to allow different races to
   develop on their own, it forced Black South Africans into poverty and
   hopelessness. “Grand” apartheid laws focused on keeping Black people in
   their own designated “homelands.” And “petty” apartheid laws focused on
   daily life restricted almost every facet of Black life in South
   Africa.

   Pass laws and apartheid policies prohibited Black people from entering
   urban areas without immediately finding a job. It was illegal for a
   Black person not to carry a passbook. Black people could not marry
   white people. They could not set up businesses in white
   areas. Everywhere from hospitals to beaches was segregated. Education
   was restricted. And throughout the 1950s, the NP passed law after law
   regulating the movement and lives of Black people.

   Though they were disempowered, Black South Africans protested their
   treatment within apartheid. In the 1950s, the African National
   Congress, the country’s oldest Black political party, initiated a mass
   mobilization against the racists laws, called the Defiance Campaign.
   Black workers boycotted white businesses, went on strike, and staged
   non-violent protests.

   These acts of defiance were met with police and state brutality.
   Protesters were beaten and tried en masse in unfair legal proceedings.
   But though the campaigns took a toll on Black protesters, they didn’t
   generate enough international pressure on the South African government
   to inspire reforms.

   In 1960, South African police killed 69 peaceful protesters in
   Sharpeville, sparking nationwide dissent and a wave of strikes. A
   subgroup of protesters who were tired of what they saw as ineffective
   nonviolent protests began to embrace armed resistance instead. Among
   them was Nelson Mandela, who helped organize a paramilitary subgroup of
   the ANC in 1960. He was arrested for treason in 1961, and was sentenced
   to life in prison for charges of sabotage in 1964.

   In response to the 1960 protests, the government declared a state of
   emergency. This tactic cleared the way for even more apartheid laws to
   be put in place. Despite the state of emergency, Black groups continued
   to organize and protest. But a crackdown on many movement leaders
   forced them into exile abroad.

   Anti-apartheid protests continued as life for Black South Africans
   became more and more dire under apartheid. On June 16, 1976, up to
   10,000 Black schoolchildren, inspired by new tenets of Black
   consciousness, marched to protest a new law that forced them to learn
   Afrikaans in schools. Steve Biko, anti-apartheid activist and
   co-founder of the South African Studentsʼ Organization, spearheaded the
   movement and was arrested multiple times for his activism before dying
   from injuries sustained while in police custody on September 12, 1977.

   During the 1980s, resistance became even more fierce. Peaceful and
   violent protests finally began to spark international attention. Nelson
   Mandela, the movement’s most powerful and well-known representative,
   had been imprisoned since 1964. But he inspired his followers to
   continue resisting and conducted secret negotiations to end apartheid.

   By the end of the 1980s, discontentment was growing among white South
   Africans about what they saw as South Africa’s diminished international
   standing. By then, the country faced sanctions and economic
   ramifications as international businesses, celebrities, and other
   governments pressured the government to end discrimination. As the
   economy faltered, the government was locked in a stalemate with
   anti-apartheid activists.

   But when South African president P.W. Botha resigned in 1989, the
   stalemate finally broke. Botha’s successor, F.W. de Klerk, decided it
   was time to negotiate to end apartheid in earnest.

   In February 1990, de Klerk lifted the ban on the ANC and other
   opposition groups and released Mandela, whose secret negotiations had
   thus far failed, from prison. Despite continued political violence,
   Mandela, de Klerk and their allies began intensive negotiations.

   In 1994, the NP was finally defeated and Mandela became president of
   South Africa. A constitutional assembly was convened and South Africa
   adopted a new constitution that allowed for a South Africa that was not
   ruled by racial discrimination. It took effect in 1997.

   By then, South Africa had dismantled apartheid for good. Mandela and de
   Klerk won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1993 for their cooperation, and a
   truth and reconciliation commission began investigating human rights
   abuses and memorializing those abuses. The transition was not entirely
   non-violent. But by its end, South Africa had forged a new reality: one
   that owed its existence to the continued resistance of an oppressed
   racial majority.
