   I am now in my final month of working for the Legal Resources Centre
   and Rhodes University as the Oxford Human Rights Hub Travelling Fellow
   for 2016. This fellowship has been an incredible experience. After
   taking courses last year in Oxford which covered South African human
   rights and non-discrimination jurisprudence, the opportunity to
   actively engage in the development of litigation in this area has been
   very rewarding. This blog relates to a current case from the office
   concerning unfair discrimination in school admissions.

   The Legal Resources Centre has issued demand papers to the MEC of the
   Eastern Cape Department of Education demanding a change to the
   admissions policy of Winterberg Agricultural High School in Fort
   Beaufort. Winterberg is a former model-C school: a whites-only public
   school under apartheid, that was, by virtue of being a white school, in
   receipt of considerably more state funding than other public schools in
   the area. Over twenty years after the transition to democracy, a clear
   economic, academic and racial disparity between Winterberg and the
   surrounding public schools still exists. Winterberg is academically the
   best public school in Fort Beaufort, has the best infrastructure and
   resources, and is the best funded as it is able to charge school fees.
   Furthermore, notwithstanding that Fort Beaufort has an overwhelmingly
   black population, black students remain disproportionately
   underrepresented at the school. While the school is no longer legally
   permitted to reject applicants on the basis of race, the school’s
   admissions policy serves to implicitly exclude black applicants that
   live within the school’s feeder zone. It is these admission
   requirements which are being challenged.

   The admissions policy states that learners whose mother tongue is
   either English or Afrikaans – the mediums of instruction at the school
   – are given preference over learners who are proficient in those
   languages but speak another language as their mother tongue. The black
   population of Fort Beaufort predominantly speak isiXhosa as their
   mother tongue, and are thereby placed at a disadvantage in admissions
   to the white or coloured populations, who speak English or Afrikaans as
   their mother tongue. An applicant who is extremely proficient at both
   English and Afrikaans but whose mother tongue is isiXhosa will be
   discriminated against in favour of an applicant who may have one of the
   two languages as their mother tongue but no proficiency in the other.

   This is unfair discrimination on the grounds of language, a protected
   ground under Section 9 of the Constitution. While the South African
   Schools Act states that it is the prerogative of the School Governing
   Body to choose the language policy of the school, it was held in
   Hoërskool Ermelo that a school’s language policy ‘must be understood
   within the broader constitutional scheme to make education
   progressively available and accessible to everyone, taking into account
   what is fair, practicable, and enhances historical redress.’
   Winterberg’s mother tongue language requirement serves no legitimate
   educational objective and rather than achieving historical redress, it
   further entrenches the existing racial imbalance in access to
   education.

   Compounding this discrimination, Winterberg’s admissions policy states
   that a preference will be given to applicants who will board at the
   school over day-learners. To be a boarder, the applicant must live
   outside the feeder area, meaning applicants from outside the feeder
   zone are preferred to learners from within the feeder zone. Not only is
   this contrary to the National Admissions Policy for Ordinary Public
   Schools which requires that schools give preference to applicants from
   within the school’s feeder zone, it also serves to implicitly
   discriminate against the local black population by prioritising
   applicants from beyond the feeder zone. The degree to which this
   enables the school to indirectly discriminate on the ground of race by
   selecting white applicants from farther away in preference to black
   applicants is reflected in the fact that Winterberg remains
   disproportionately white notwithstanding that only 2.6% of the
   population of Fort Beaufort are white.

   The Legal Resources Centre are challenging the school’s admission
   policies both in relation to direct discrimination on the grounds of
   mother language and indirect discrimination in relation to unfairly
   excluding applicants from within school’s overwhelmingly black feeder
   zone. The case continues.
