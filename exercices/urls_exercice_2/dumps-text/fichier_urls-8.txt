Racial Discrimination still rife in African public healthcare systems

An interview with ARASA Advocacy Officer, Thuthukile Mbatha for International
Day for the Elimination against Racial Discrimination

   Despite the end of colonialism and Apartheid, racial discrimination
   still occurs in Africa, especially in South Africa, and has a huge
   impact on our access to sexual and reproductive health rights (SRHR).
   To celebrate International Day for the Elimination of Racial
   Discrimination, Advocacy Officer to the AIDS and Rights Alliance of
   Southern Africa (ARASA), Thuthukile Mbatha, says that in order to
   ensure SRHR for all Africans we must make them aware of their rights
   and continue to press for policy reform on the continent.

   According to Mbatha, racism is systemically entrenched in our
   healthcare systems, with the greatest divide in service provision being
   most apparent when you compare public healthcare in affluent
   neighbourhoods to public healthcare in informal settlements and rural
   areas.

   ‚ÄúThe quality of healthcare depends on the facility‚Äôs geographical
   location. We are still dealing with the remnants of colonial
   architecture. Look at a public clinic in the wealthy suburb of Sandton,
   in Johannesburg that serves mostly white people. It‚Äôs clean,
   well-equipped and the staff are responsive. Cross the street to the
   clinic in the informal settlement, Alexandra and it is an entirely
   different story. It‚Äôs over-crowded, the service is terrible and there
   is no respect for the confidentiality of the patients‚Äù, she said.

   Mbatha further stated that racial discrimination is so entrenched in
   the minds of African people, that they accept poor healthcare without
   question. She said that public healthcare has gradually deteriorated
   across the continent and racial discrimination is inextricably linked
   to classist mentalities.

   ‚ÄúIn many African countries, the right to quality public healthcare is
   enshrined in national Constitutions and should be an immediately
   attainable right. Unfortunately, the majority of those suffering from
   shoddy healthcare services are poor, black, Africans. African leaders
   who can afford to pay for quality private healthcare when they are ill,
   do not invest in public healthcare for their people. During the
   Covid-19 pandemic we saw how quickly funds were made available to
   respond to the health crisis. The excuse that there is no funding to
   improve public healthcare systems, is unacceptable‚Äù, said Mbatha.

   In order to end racial discrimination in public healthcare and ensure
   SRHR for all Africans, Mbatha says it will take a concerted effort by
   the public, civil society and governments.

   ‚ÄúFirstly, we need to ensure that healthcare practitioners learn to
   treat all Africans with dignity and respect, regardless of their sexual
   orientation, gender, race or socio-economic background. The
   neo-colonialist mentality of having absolute authority over others as a
   civil servant, needs to end. We also need to empower Africans by making
   sure they understand their right to fair treatment in the public health
   sector. And finally, as civil society organisations, we have a
   responsibility to pressure policy makers to make funding for SRHR a
   priority‚Äù, she said.

   Mbatha was appointed as Advocacy Officer for ARASA in 2021 and promotes
   bodily autonomy and integrity, and awareness surrounding sexual and
   reproductive health rights across the continent. To access ARASA‚Äôs free
