   internal memo about future hiring trends was leaked on social media.

   Dis-Chem's CEO Ivan Saltzman called on managers to help the company
   improve its employment equity profile and effect transformation by
   halting the hiring of white individuals.

   Organisations such as AfriForum and the Democratic Alliance have
   weighed in on the pharmaceutical retailer's decision to hire and
   promote more black individuals because the company has been unable to
   meet the required standards.

   AfriForum's Ernst van Zyl told SABC News that Dis-Chem's hiring policy
   amounts to racial discrimination no matter how it is framed. Van Zyl
   also argued that people who favour the Dis-Chem's policy are
   essentially "pro-racial discrimination."

     "It is racial discrimination by telling people they are not going to
     get a job or promotion based on their skin colour and that is why
     AfriForum is against it," said Van Zyl.

The Democratic Alliance weighs in on Dis-Chem's controversial hiring policy

   The Democratic Alliance (DA) says Dis-Chem's hiring policy is a
   consequence of the amendment made in the Employment Equity Amendment
   Bill, explaining that it will cause even more controversy.

   The party argues that the amendment bill does not align with Employment
   Equity Act and has been heavily opposed by Members of Parliament,
   reports EWN.

   DA's Michael Cardo stated that the bill would only destroy South
   Africa's economy. The party added that Dis-Chem was only doing what
   other businesses in similar positions will be forced to do when the
   bill is enacted.

South Africans weigh in on the Dis-Chem hiring scandal

   Heading online, Briefly News asked readers how they felt about
   Dis-Chem's decision to stop hiring white people until they have reached
   the quota for hiring black candidates.

   Some people seemed to believe that the hiring policy was fair because
   white people have historically benefitted more than black people;
   however, some believed that individuals should be hired on merit.

   Here are some comments:

   Vuyani Abner Ngqase said:

     "Yes, it's fair white people have been milking the economy for years
     now, from British times to the apartheid times. Even now, they still
     want to milk what is left... it's time to put South Africans first;
     white people are not South Africans."

     "Hiring more black people sounds good. What about selling more herbs
     owned by black people?"

   Great Kev said:

     "They should hire qualified people regardless of race. This thing of
     hiring people based on anything but qualification or experience is
     costly and retrogressive."

   Evans Zivanai Muudzwa said:

     It will be madness at its best. Let the best candidate take the job
     no matter what race is. What is needed is brilliant brains.

   Bonginkosi T Gcaba said:

     "I don't think it is fair I think our BEE laws are not correcting
     the imbalances of the past, but they are further increasing the
     imbalances maybe our government must review these laws. Yes, we all
     know that blacks are still suffering from the past, but that doesn't
     mean the black government must implement laws that discriminate
     against citizens."

   Sipho M'shayi Dibaba PovandinowskiKathrada said:

     "We do not care, as long as people are being hired, that is what
     matters."

     "It's not fair. People should be hired based on merit, Qualification

     economic opportunities for black people now they are shoving them
     where they can to compensate for their failures, black people
     deserve so much more than these lousy affirmative actions that
     ineffective."

   Macheru Rachel Rain said:

   be hired on merit.
