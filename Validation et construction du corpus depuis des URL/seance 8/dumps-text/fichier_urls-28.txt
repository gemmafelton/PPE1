   Violence outside a South African school between residents and activists
   from the Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) over alleged racism could be
   used to "cause racial polarisation", President Cyril Ramaphosa has
   warned.

   The EFF said its members were attacked by "right-wingers" while
   protesting against a whites-only graduation party.

   The school in Cape Town said it had nothing to do with the event.

   White-minority rule ended in South Africa in 1994.

   In a statement, Mr Ramaphosa said that "the spectacle of parents and
   protestors coming to blows at the school gate is deeply unfortunate".

   "What happened... brings back hurtful memories of a past we should
   never seek to return to."

   He called on all sides to exercise restraint and resolve the tensions
   peacefully.

   A legalised system of racial discrimination, known as apartheid, was
   abolished in the run up to the country's first democratic election in
   1994, when all race groups voted.

   broke out

   Racist education policies under the system became a rallying point for
   anti-apartheid activists.

   On Monday, in response to the call by the EFF opposition party for a
   protest at Brackenfell High, parents, residents and security guards
   gathered outside the school, the Cape Argus newspaper reports.

   Pictures and video being shared online showed EFF members being shouted
   at and then fighting breaking out, which the police struggled to
   contain.

   In a statement, the EFF, which is the second-biggest opposition party
   in South Africa, said the protest was peaceful and "armed
   right-wingers" attacked its members "in what was a display of pure
   white arrogance".

   "It must be further noted that since 1994, there has never been a
   single black teacher at Brackenfell High School, which reveals how
   entrenched racism is at the school at an institutional level," the
   party added.

   A parent and former pupil were quoted by local media as saying the
   school was not racist, and the protest was uncalled for.

   Brackenfell High has distanced itself from the private graduation
   party, which, the EFF said, was only attended by white people. Two
   school teachers were also reportedly present.

'Don't bring back segregation'

   "The masked ball... was a private party organised by the parents... and
   did not fall under the control of the school," the school authorities
   said in a letter to parents sent on Sunday.

   They added that only 42 of the school's 254 graduating students
   attended and that Brackenfell High does not "condone or accommodate any
   events that are exclusively reserved for certain groups".

   The school also asked parents not to get involved in any violence.

   Referring to the reports that only white people attended the party, the
   South African Human Rights Commission, which is a statutory body, said
   that "no-one should be allowed to bring back racial segregation to this
   country".

   "The deep racial divisions of South Africa's apartheid and colonial
   past cannot be healed while children are socialised separately on the
   basis of race," it added.
