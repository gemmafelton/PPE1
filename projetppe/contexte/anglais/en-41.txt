   air pollution, stress from different sources - including perceived
   racial discrimination - and jobs or working conditions," he said,

   racism, which Jackson considers as the "totality of ways in which
   societies foster racial discrimination through mutually reinforcing
   systems of housing, education, employment, wages, benefits, credit,
   media, health care and criminal justice."
