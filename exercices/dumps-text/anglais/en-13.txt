   Racial discrimination panel discussion insights 21 march event

Racial discrimination in Sweden and the United States - March 21 Follow up
content

     [50]March 29, 2021January 20, 2022

Continue to explore racial discrimination issues in Sweden and the United
States through our additional content

   On March 21st The Raoul Wallenberg together with Kino organised the
   [51]second event of the Swedish Human Rights Film Festival. We marked
   the International Day for the Elimination of Racial Discrimination with
   a panel discussion on racial discrimination in Sweden and the US. Aysha
   Jones, Founder of the Black Lives Matter and Irene Molina, Pr. in Human
   Geography at Uppsala University offered us their views on this very
   topical subject.

   Feel free to watch the event and read about its main insights [52]here.

   In addition, the Institute would like to continue the conversation with
   you and explore more in depth this topic. You can therefore find below
   interviews and podcasts with international experts. We discussed with
   them more specific issues such as the Black Lives Matter Movement and
   the engagement of civil society.
