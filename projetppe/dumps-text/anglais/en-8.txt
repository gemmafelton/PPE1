Little progress combating systemic racism against people of African descent:
UN report

   30 September 2022 [69]Human Rights

   More than two years since the murder of George Floyd by a police
   officer in the United States sparked the global Black Lives Matter
   movement, there's been only "piecemeal progress" in addressing systemic
   racism, the UN human rights office (OHCHR) said on Friday, in a new
   report.

   While more people have been made aware of systemic racism and concrete
   steps have been taken in some countries, the Acting High Commissioner
   for Human Rights called on States to demonstrate greater political will
   to accelerate action.

   Systemic racism against people of #AfricanDescent continues to inflict
   deep harm. Piecemeal progress is not enough. New @UN report calls for
   transformative change to dismantle deep-rooted systems perpetuating
   racial discrimination: [70]https://t.co/K5Oi150TTn

   UNHumanRights
   September 30, 2022

   "There have been some initiatives in different countries to address
   racism, but for the most part they are piecemeal. They fall short of
   the comprehensive evidence-based approaches needed to dismantle the
   entrenched structural, institutional and societal racism that has
   existed for centuries, and continues to inflict deep harm today," said
   Nada Al-Nashif, who will present the report to the UN [72]Human Rights
   Council on Monday.

   She specifically pointed to key recommendations made in
   [73]OHCHR's [74]Agenda towards Transformative Change for Racial Justice
   and Equality.

Triggering change

   The report describes international, national and local initiatives that
   have been taken, towards ending the scourge of racism.

   These include an Executive Order from the White House on advancing
   effective, accountable policing and criminal justice practices in
   federal law enforcement agencies; an Anti-Racism Data Act in British
   Columbia, Canada; measures to evaluate ethnic profiling by police in
   Sweden; and census data collection to self-identify people of African
   descent in Argentina.

   The European Commission has issued guidance on collecting and using
   data based on racial or ethnic origin; formal apologies issued,
   memorialization, revisiting public spaces, and research, to assess
   links to enslavement and colonialism in several countries.

`Barometer for success'

   The report notes that poor outcomes continue for people of African
   descent in many countries, notably in accessing health and adequate
   food, education, social protection, and justice - while poverty,
   enforced disappearance and violence continues.

   It highlights "continuing...allegations of discriminatory treatment,
   unlawful deportations, excessive use of force, and deaths of African
   migrants and migrants of African descent by law enforcement officials"

   "The barometer for success must be positive change in the lived
   experiences of people of African descent," continued Ms. Al-Nashif.

   "States need to listen to people of African descent, meaningfully
   involve them and take genuine steps to act upon their concerns."

   Tennessee, during the Civil Rights Movement in the USA.

Higher death rates

   Where available, recent data still points to disproportionately high
   death rates faced by people of African descent, at the hands of law
   enforcement, in different countries.

   "Families of African descent continued to report the immense
   challenges, barriers and protracted processes they faced in their
   pursuit of truth and justice for the deaths of their relatives", the
   report says.

   It details seven cases of police-related deaths of people of African
   descent, namely George Floyd and Breonna Taylor (US); Adama Traoré
   (France); Luana Barbosa dos Reis Santos and João Pedro Matos Pinto
   (Brazil); Kevin Clarke (UK) and Janner [Hanner] García Palomino
   (Colombia).

   While noting some progress towards accountability in a few of these
   emblematic cases, "unfortunately, not a single case has yet been
   brought to a full conclusion, with those families still seeking truth,
   justice and guarantees of non-repetition, and the prosecution and
   sanction of all those responsible," the report says.

   Ms. Al-Nashif called on States to "redouble efforts to ensure
   accountability and redress wherever deaths of Africans and people of
   African descent have occurred in the context of law enforcement, and
   take measures to confront legacies that perpetuate and sustain systemic
   racism".
