   segregation of African Americans. Another reason for the rise of the
   movement can be called the economic superiority of the white population
   over the blacks. The starting point was the stereotypes entrenched in

   not even have the right to vote, children could not study on an equal
   basis with others, discrimination even touched places on buses.
