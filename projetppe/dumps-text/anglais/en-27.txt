The Latest Threat to the Voting Rights Act: Merrill v. Milligan

   Blog / Last Updated: December 8, 2022

   Share this:

   This blog was written by legal intern Gabby Means.

   In the last decade, the US Supreme Court has severely weakened the
   Voting Rights Act of 1965 (VRA), which was widely agreed to be [34]the
   most effective civil rights law in our history.

   Beginning with its 2013 decision in Shelby County v. Holder, which
   [35]gutted the VRA by [36]rendering Section 5 ineffective, the Court
   has chipped away at the power of the VRA. Most recently, the Court
   weakened Section 2 of the VRA, one of the last protections against
   racially discriminatory voting laws. It did so in the 2021 decision in
   Brnovich v. Democratic National Committee, where the Court [37]made it
   more difficult for voting rights plaintiffs to challenge racially
   discriminatory voting laws in court.

   This term, the Court considers Section 2 again in [38]Merrill v.
   Milligan. This time, the Court threatens to weaken well-established
   precedent lower courts have used for decades to evaluate redistricting
   plans alleged to be racially discriminatory. In this blog, we will
   explore the history of Section 2 and its impact on discriminatory
   redistricting plans, explain the dispute at issue in Milligan, and
   preview potential next steps to protect voting rights.

Background on the Voting Rights Act

   The VRA was passed in response to deliberate efforts to prevent Black
   Americans from voting, including violence and terror. States --
   particularly in the South -- were thwarting their pro-equality,
   anti-discrimination obligations under the Fourteenth and Fifteenth
   Amendments, and Congress determined further protections were
   required.

   The VRA created remarkable remedies and protections to ensure that no
   one is prevented from participating in the political process because of
   their race. Its core protections are in Section 5 and Section 2 of the
   Act. Section 5 established a system of "federal preclearance," which
   required jurisdictions with a history of racial discrimination in
   voting to seek preapproval before making any changes to their voting
   practices. For voters harmed by jurisdictions with racially
   discriminatory voting policies and practices, Section 2 provided them
   with legal recourse.

   The Voting Rights Act was reauthorized -- with strong bipartisan
   support -- multiple times, most recently in 2006. But in 2013, the US
   Supreme Court held that the Section 5 coverage formula for determining
   which jurisdictions must submit to federal preclearance was not
   justified by current conditions. The decision essentially nullified
   Section 5 until a new coverage formula is passed in Congress (which has
   yet to occur). As the late Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg noted in her
   dissent, "throwing out preclearance when it has worked and is
   continuing to work to stop discriminatory changes is like throwing away
   your umbrella in a rainstorm because you are not getting wet."
   Unsurprisingly, since this decision, several restrictive state voting
   rights laws have been enacted.

   Section 2 of the VRA has always been critical to protect voters, but
   without a functioning Section 5, Section 2 is even more necessary to
   challenge policies and practices that intend to or effect of harming
   voters of color. As explored below, Merrill v. Milligan threatens
   Section 2 and voters' ability to use it to challenge racial
   discrimination in voting.

Claims Under Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act: Vote Denial & Vote Dilution

   Under Section 2(a) of the VRA, states may not pass any law that
   "results in a denial or abridgment" of the right to vote "on account of
   race or color." Put simply, Section 2 prohibits any standard, practice,
   or procedure imposed or applied to deny or limit the right to vote
   based on race or color.

   Cases brought under Section 2 [40]have historically involved two types
   of violations:

   1) Vote dilution; and

   2) Vote denial.

Vote Denial

   Vote denial claims typically challenge practices that render voting
   "not equally open to participation" for voters protected by Section 2
   -- racial and language minority groups. They became more common as
   states rushed to pass restrictive voting laws after the Shelby County
   decision. A common vote denial claim post-Shelby County are challenges
   to restrictive photo ID laws that disproportionately prevent voters of
   color from voting.

   Until the ruling in Brnovich, the Supreme Court had not squarely
   addressed Section 2 vote denial claims. [41]As noted in our previous
   blog, the Court in Brnovich dealt a blow to voters' ability to
   challenge racial discrimination in voting under Section 2.

Vote Dilution

   [42]The most common and well-established use of Section 2 -- and the
   claim raised in Milligan v. Merrill -- is a vote dilution claim, raised
   [43]in the context of redistricting and changes to jurisdiction
   boundaries. A violation of Section 2 occurs when states draw districts
   in a way that gives voters of color less power "to elect
   representatives of their choice."

   The earliest vote dilution cases concerned at-large voting; an election
   scheme used to drown out the power of voters of color. More recently,
   vote dilution claims have been brought to challenge redistricting plans
   that dilute the political power of Black residents and other
   communities of color on the local, state, and federal levels.

   The Supreme Court has decided several vote dilution cases since the VRA
   was passed in 1965, including Thornburg v. Gingles in 1986, which
   established the test to evaluate claims of racial vote dilution in
   district boundaries. To establish a Section 2 violation under Gingles,
   plaintiffs must show that instead of the challenged map or boundaries
   which dilute the power of voters of color, an acceptable district could
   be drawn that would allow voters of color to elect a candidate of
   choice.

Merrill v. Milligan

   On October 4, 2022, the Supreme Court heard oral arguments in Merrill
   v. Milligan. Plaintiffs -- Alabama voters and voting rights
   organizations -- challenged the congressional map passed by the Alabama
   legislature after the 2020 census. The new map maintained only one
   majority-Black congressional district out of seven total districts,
   despite the fact that 27% of the Alabama population is Black. This
   percentage suggests that there could -- and, according to the Milligan
   plaintiffs, should -- be two districts where Black voters can elect a
   candidate of choice. After the presentation of evidence, a three-judge
   panel at the district court found a likely Section 2 violation and
   irreparable harm to Black voters. The court ordered lawmakers to draw a
   new map that satisfies the requirements of Section 2.

   Instead of accepting the ruling and working to address the violation on
   behalf of the state's Black voters, the state filed an emergency appeal
   to the Supreme Court to halt the lower court order suspending Alabama's
   map. The Supreme Court agreed, which meant that the Alabama
   congressional map, which a three-judge panel had struck down at the
   federal district court, would be in place for the upcoming 2022
   election season. On October 4, 2022, the Supreme Court heard oral
   arguments.

   demanding fair maps

   Merrill v. Milligan is a straightforward vote dilution case, with an
   outcome dictated by Supreme Court precedent. As Justice Kagan noted
   during oral arguments, "this case should be a slam dunk." Even Chief
   Justice Roberts agreed in his dissent to the emergency stay order,
   stating, "the District Court properly applied existing law in an
   extensive opinion with no apparent errors for our correction." So why
   is the Supreme Court hearing this case?

   The state argues that its "race-neutral" map -- which only creates one
   majority-Black congressional district -- should not be disqualified
   just because it is possible to draw two majority-Black districts in
   Alabama. They suggest that the VRA prohibits denying votes on account
   of race but does not affirmatively obligate states to redistrict on
   account of race. The state urges that the first prong of the Gingles
   test, that the community of color must be "sufficiently large and
   geographically compact to constitute a majority in a single-member
   district," should be a race-blind test. Alabama's argument does not
   square with the purpose and history of the VRA, which is specifically
   focused on rooting out racial discrimination in voting pursuant to
   Congress's power to enforce the Fourteenth Amendment.

   Alabama voters in the Milligan case argue that Alabama violated Section
   2 by [44]"packing" and "cracking" Black residents to limit their
   political power. Importantly, they also argue that requiring the first
   prong of Gingles to be race-blind would defeat the purpose of Section
   2, which is to protect voters of color from having their political
   power diminished. During oral argument, Supreme Court Justice Ketanji
   Brown Jackson acknowledged the historical importance of race in VRA
   case law, noting that "it became clear to me that the framers
   themselves adopted the equal protection clause, the Fourteenth
   Amendment, the Fifteenth Amendment, in a race-conscious way. That they
   were, in fact, trying to ensure that people who had been discriminated
   against . . . were brought equal to everyone else in the society."

   [45]Learn More About Our Legal Cases

   The League of Women Voters of Alabama and the League of Women Voters of
   the United States filed an amicus brief supporting Alabama voters in
   the case, along with the Southern Poverty Law Center and Stand-Up
   Mobile. The League's brief urges the Supreme Court to uphold the
   district court ruling, which found a violation of Section 2. The brief
   explains how a second majority-Black district can be drawn to satisfy
   Section 2 by combining two communities in Alabama with deep ties to
   each other: the city of Mobile and Alabama's Black Belt. [46]The brief
   can be found here.

What's Next?

   It's essential that the Supreme Court uphold the Alabama district court
   ruling and protect the longstanding protections Section 2 provides for
   voters. Should the Court rule in Alabama's favor, future rulings
   striking down racially discriminatory redistricting plans could be put
   at risk. This is already occurring: in June 2022, [47]a district court
   in Louisiana found a Section 2 violation for that state's congressional
   map, but the decision has stayed pending the outcoming in Milligan. The
   racially discriminatory Louisiana congressional map has thus been
   allowed to go into effect for the 2022 election season. If the Supreme
   Court rules in favor of Alabama, the Louisiana case could suffer the
   same fate.

   This case emphasizes the importance of restoring the Voting Rights Act
   to its full strength and passing federal voting rights protections.
   Encourage your representatives to do so: let Congress know they must
   pass the [48]John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act and the Freedom
   to Vote Act to protect voters from discriminatory and suppressive
   voting practices.

   A decision in Merrill v. Milligan is expected in the spring or summer
   of 2023.

   [52]Brnovich: A Significant Blow to Our Freedom to Vote

   On July 1, in [53]Brnovich v. Democratic National Committee, the
   Supreme Court dealt a significant blow to the freedom to vote. The
   decision held that Arizona laws discounting ballots cast out of
   precinct and banning nonrelative neighbors or friends to deliver
   mail-in ballots did not violate the Voting Rights Act of 1965, despite
   these laws' negative effects on Black and brown voters. It is a major
   loss for voting rights at a time when this sacred freedom is under
   attack across the nation.
