   SpongeBob SquarePants (or simply SpongeBob) is an American animated
   comedy television series created by marine science educator and
   animator Stephen Hillenburg for Nickelodeon. It chronicles the
   adventures of the title character and his aquatic friends in the
   fictional underwater city of Bikini Bottom. The fifth-longest-running
   American animated series, its high popularity has made it a media
   franchise. It is the third-most-profitable property in the portfolio of
   Paramount Global, behind fellow Nickelodeon franchises Dora the
   Explorer and Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles.

   Many of the series's ideas originated in The Intertidal Zone, an
   unpublished educational comic book Hillenburg created in 1989 to teach
   his students about undersea life.^[4] He began developing SpongeBob
   SquarePants into a television series in 1996, and in 1997, a
   seven-minute pilot was pitched to Nickelodeon. The network's executives
   wanted SpongeBob to be a child in school, but Hillenburg preferred
   SpongeBob to be an adult character.^[5] He was prepared to abandon the
   series, but compromised by creating Mrs. Puff and her boating school so
   SpongeBob could attend school as an adult.^[6]

   Nickelodeon aired a preview for the series in the United States on May
   1, 1999, after the airing of the 1999 Kids' Choice Awards. The series
   officially premiered on July 17, 1999. It gained enormous popularity by
   its second season, and has subsequently received worldwide critical
   acclaim. The thirteenth season began in October 2020,^[7] and the
   series was renewed for a fourteenth season on March 24, 2022.^[8] It
   has inspired three feature films: The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie
   (2004), Sponge Out of Water (2015), and Sponge on the Run (2020). Two
   spin-off series, Kamp Koral: SpongeBob's Under Years and The Patrick
   Star Show, premiered in 2021. As of February 2022, four additional
   films are planned: three character spinoff films for Paramount+, and a
   new theatrical SpongeBob film.

   SpongeBob SquarePants has won a variety of awards including six Annie
   Awards, eight Golden Reel Awards, four Emmy Awards, 19 Kids' Choice
   Awards, and two BAFTA Children's Awards. A Broadway musical based on it
   opened in 2017 to critical acclaim.^[9]

Premise

Setting

   A blue colored image of an atoll.
   Bikini Atoll, a coral reef in the Pacific Ocean. Tom Kenny confirmed
   the fictitious city of Bikini Bottom is named after Bikini Atoll.

   The series takes place primarily in the fictional benthic underwater
   city of Bikini Bottom located in the Pacific Ocean beneath the
   real-life coral reef known as Bikini Atoll.^[10]^[11]^[12]^[c] Its
   citizens are mostly multicolored fish who live in buildings made from
   ship funnels and use "boatmobiles", amalgamations of cars and boats, as
   a mode of transportation. Recurring locations within Bikini Bottom
   include the neighboring houses of SpongeBob, Patrick, and Squidward;
   two competing restaurants, the Krusty Krab and the Chum Bucket; Mrs.
   Puff's Boating School, which includes a driving course and a sunken
   lighthouse; the Treedome, an oxygenated glass enclosure where Sandy
   lives; Shady Shoals Rest Home; a seagrass meadow called Jellyfish
   Fields; and Goo Lagoon, a subaqueous brine pool that is a popular beach
   hangout.^[14]

   When the SpongeBob crew began production of the series' pilot episode,
   they were tasked with designing stock locations, to be used repeatedly,
   where most scenes would take place like the Krusty Krab and SpongeBob's
   pineapple house.^[15] The idea was "to keep everything nautical", so
   the crew used plenty of rope, wooden planks, ships' wheels, netting,
   anchors, boilerplates, and rivets to create the show's setting.
   Transitions between scenes are marked by bubbles filling the screen,
   accompanied by the sound of rushing water.^[15]

   The series features "sky flowers" as a main setting material.^[15] When
   series background designer Kenny Pittenger was asked what they were, he
   answered, "They function as clouds in a way, but since the show takes
   place underwater, they aren't really clouds. Because of the tiki
   influence on the show, the background painters use a lot of
   pattern."^[15] Pittenger said the sky flowers were meant to "evoke the
   look of a flower-print Hawaiian shirt".^[15]

Characters

   The series' main characters. Top row, from left to right: Pearl,
   Plankton, and Karen. Bottom row: Sandy, Mr. Krabs, SpongeBob,
   Squidward, Gary, Patrick, and Mrs. Puff.

   The series revolves around the title character and an ensemble cast of
   his aquatic friends. SpongeBob SquarePants is an energetic and
   optimistic yellow sea sponge who lives in a submerged pineapple.
   SpongeBob has a childlike enthusiasm for life, which carries over to
   his job as a fry cook at a fast food restaurant called the Krusty Krab.
   One of his life's greatest goals is to obtain a boat-driving license
   from Mrs. Puff's Boating School, but he never succeeds. His favorite
   pastimes include "jellyfishing", which involves catching jellyfish with
   a net in a manner similar to butterfly catching, and blowing soap
   bubbles into elaborate shapes. He has a pet sea snail with a pink shell
   and a blue body named Gary, who meows like a cat.

   Living two houses away from SpongeBob is his best friend Patrick Star,
   a dim-witted yet friendly pink starfish who resides under a rock.
   Despite his mental setbacks, Patrick sees himself as intelligent.^[16]
   Squidward Tentacles, SpongeBob's next-door neighbor and co-worker at
   the Krusty Krab, is an arrogant, ill-tempered octopus who lives in an
   Easter Island moai. He enjoys playing the clarinet and painting
   self-portraits but hates his job as a cashier. He also dislikes living
   between SpongeBob and Patrick because of their childish nature. The
   owner of the Krusty Krab is a miserly, greedy red crab named Mr. Krabs
   who talks like a sailor and runs his restaurant as if it were a pirate
   ship. He is a single parent with a teenage daughter, a grey sperm whale
   with red lipstick and a yellow ponytail named Pearl, to whom he wants
   to bequeath his riches. Pearl does not want to continue the family
   business and would rather spend her time listening to music or working
   at the local shopping mall.^[17] Another of SpongeBob's friends is
   Sandy Cheeks, a thrill-seeking and athletic squirrel from Texas, who
   wears an air-filled diving suit to breathe underwater.^[18] She lives
   in a tree enclosed in a clear glass dome locked by an airtight,
   hand-turned seal and is an expert in karate, as well as a scientist.

   Located across the street from the Krusty Krab is an unsuccessful rival
   restaurant called the Chum Bucket.^[19] It is run by a small, green,
   one-eyed copepod^[20] named Plankton and his computer wife, Karen.^[21]
   Plankton constantly tries to steal the secret recipe for Mr. Krabs's
   popular Krabby Patty burgers, hoping to gain the upper hand and put the
   Krusty Krab out of business.^[22] Karen supplies him with evil schemes
   to obtain the formula, but their efforts always fail and their
   restaurant rarely has any customers.^[23] When SpongeBob is not working
   at the Krusty Krab, he is often taking boating lessons from Mrs. Puff,
   a paranoid but patient pufferfish. SpongeBob is Mrs. Puff's most
   diligent student and knows every answer to the oral exams he takes, but
   he panics and crashes when he tries to drive a real boat.^[24] When
   Mrs. Puff endures one of SpongeBob's crashes or is otherwise
   frightened, she puffs up into a ball.^[25]

   An unseen figure called the French Narrator often introduces episodes
   and narrates the intertitles as if the series were a nature documentary
   about the ocean. His role and distinctive manner of speaking are
   references to the oceanographer Jacques Cousteau.^[26]

   Recurring guest characters appear throughout the series including: the
   retired superheroes Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy, who are idolized by
   SpongeBob and Patrick; a pirate specter known as the Flying Dutchman;
   the muscular lifeguard of Goo Lagoon, Larry the Lobster; and the merman
   god of the sea, King Neptune.

   Special (generally half-hour or hour-long) episodes of the show are
   hosted by a live-action pirate named Patchy and his pet parrot Potty,
   whose segments are presented in a dual narrative with the animated
   stories.^[27] Patchy is portrayed as the president of a fictional
   SpongeBob fan club, and his greatest aspiration is to meet SpongeBob
   himself. Potty likes to make fun of Patchy's enthusiasm and causes
   trouble for him while he tries to host the show.

Production

Development

Early inspirations

   Aerial photograph of the Ocean Institute at Dana Point, California
   Before creating SpongeBob SquarePants, Stephen Hillenburg taught marine
   biology to visitors of the Ocean Institute (located in Dana Point,
   California).^[28]

   Series' creator Stephen Hillenburg first became fascinated with the
   ocean as a child and began developing his artistic abilities at a young
   age. Although these interests would not overlap for some timeâ€”the idea
   of drawing fish seemed boring to himâ€”Hillenburg pursued both during
   college, majoring in marine biology and minoring in art. After
   graduating in 1984, he joined the Ocean Institute, an organization in
   Dana Point, California, dedicated to educating the public about marine
   science and maritime history.^[28]^[29]

   While Hillenburg was there, his love of the ocean began to influence
   his artistry. He created a precursor to SpongeBob SquarePants: a comic
   book titled The Intertidal Zone used by the institute to teach visiting
   students about the animal life of tide pools.^[29] The comic starred
   various anthropomorphic sea lifeforms, many of which would evolve into
   SpongeBob SquarePants characters.^[30] Hillenburg tried to get the
   comic professionally published, but none of the companies he sent it to
   were interested.^[29]

   A large inspiration to Hillenburg was Ween's 1997 album The Mollusk,
   which had a nautical and underwater theme. Hillenburg contacted the
   band shortly after the album's release, explaining the baseline ideas
   for SpongeBob SquarePants, and also requested a song from the band,
   which they sent on Christmas Eve. This song was "Loop de Loop", which
   was used in the episode "Your Shoe's Untied".^[31]^[32]^[33]

Conception

   While working as a staff artist at the Ocean Institute, Hillenburg
   entertained plans to return eventually to college for a master's degree
   in art. Before this could materialize, he attended an animation
   festival, which inspired him to make a slight change in course. Instead
   of continuing his education with a traditional art program, Hillenburg
   chose to study experimental animation at the California Institute of
   the Arts.^[29] His thesis film, Wormholes, is about the theory of
   relativity.^[34] It was screened at festivals, and at one of these,
   Hillenburg met Joe Murray, creator of the popular Nickelodeon animated
   series, Rocko's Modern Life. Murray was impressed by the style of the
   film and offered Hillenburg a job.^[34]^[35] Hillenburg joined the
   series as a director, and later, during the fourth season, he took on
   the roles of producer and creative director.^[30]^[34]^[35]^[36]

   Martin Olson, one of the writers for Rocko's Modern Life, read The
   Intertidal Zone and encouraged Hillenburg to create a television series
   with a similar concept. At that point, Hillenburg had not even
   considered creating his own series. However, he realized that if he
   ever did, this would be the best approach.^[29]^[34]^[37] He began to
   develop some of the characters from The Intertidal Zone, including the
   comic's "announcer", Bob the Sponge.^[29] He wanted his series to stand
   out from most popular cartoons of the time, which he felt were
   exemplified by buddy comedies like The Ren & Stimpy Show. As a result,
   Hillenburg decided to focus on a single main character: the "weirdest"
   sea creature he could think of. This led him to the sponge.^[29] The
   Intertidal Zone's Bob the Sponge resembles an actual sea sponge, and at
   first, Hillenburg continued to use this design.^[29]^[34]^[35]^[38] In
   determining the new character's behavior, Hillenburg drew inspiration
   from innocent, childlike figures that he enjoyed, such as Charlie
   Chaplin, Laurel and Hardy, Jerry Lewis, and Pee-wee
   Herman.^[29]^[35]^[39]^[40]^[41] He then considered modeling the
   character after a kitchen sponge and realized this idea would match the
   character's square personality perfectly.^[29]^[34]^[35] Patrick, Mr.
   Krabs, Pearl, and Squidward were the next characters Hillenburg created
   for the show.^[42]

   To voice the series' central character, Hillenburg turned to Tom Kenny,
   whose career in animation had started alongside Hillenburg's on Rocko's
   Modern Life. Elements of Kenny's own personality were employed to
   develop the character further.^[43] Initially, Hillenburg wanted to use
   the name SpongeBoyâ€”the character had no last nameâ€”and the series was to
   have been called SpongeBoy Ahoy!^[38]^[43] However, the Nickelodeon
   legal department discoveredâ€”after voice acting had been completed for
   the original seven-minute pilot episodeâ€”that the name "SpongeBoy" was
   already copyrighted.^[44]^[43] In choosing a replacement name,
   Hillenburg felt he still had to use the word "Sponge", so that viewers
   would not mistake the character for a "Cheese Man". He settled on the
   name "SpongeBob". "SquarePants" was chosen as a family name after Kenny
   saw a picture of the character and remarked, "Boy, look at this sponge
   in square pants, thinking he can get a job in a fast food place."^[39]
   When he heard Kenny say it Hillenburg loved the phrase and felt it
   would reinforce the character's nerdiness.^[39]^[45]

Assembling the crew

   Derek Drymon, who served as creative director for the first three
   seasons, has said that Hillenburg wanted to surround himself with a
   "team of young and hungry people."^[40] Many of the major contributors
   to SpongeBob SquarePants had worked before with Hillenburg on Rocko's
   Modern Life: this included: Drymon, art director Nick Jennings,
   supervising director Alan Smart, writer/voice actor Doug Lawrence
   (often credited as Mr. Lawrence), and Tim Hill, who helped develop the
   series bible.^[40]^[41]

   Although Drymon would go on to have a significant influence on
   SpongeBob SquarePants, he was not offered a role on the series
   initially. As a late recruit to Rocko's Modern Life, he had not
   established much of a relationship with Hillenburg before SpongeBob's
   conception. Hillenburg first sought out Drymon's storyboard partner,
   Mark O'Hareâ€”but he had just created the soon-to-be syndicated comic
   strip, Citizen Dog.^[40] While he would later join SpongeBob as a
   writer,^[46] he lacked the time to get involved with both projects from
   the outset.^[40] Drymon has said, "I remember Hillenburg's bringing it
   up to Mark in our office and asking him if he'd be interested in
   working on it ... I was all ready to say yes to the offer, but Steve
   didn't ask; he just left the room. I was pretty desperate ... so I ran
   into the hall after him and basically begged him for the job. He didn't
   jump at the chance."^[40] Once Hillenburg had given it some thought and
   decided to bring Drymon on as creative director, the two began meeting
   at Hillenburg's house several times a week to develop the series.
   Drymon has identified this period as having begun in 1996, shortly
   after the end of Rocko's Modern Life.^[40]

   Jennings was also instrumental in SpongeBob's genesis.^[47] Kenny has
   called him "one of SpongeBob's early graphics mentors".^[41] On
   weekends, Kenny joined Hillenburg, Jennings, and Drymon for creative
   sessions where they recorded ideas on a tape recorder.^[41] Kenny
   performed audio tests as SpongeBob during these sessions, while
   Hillenburg voice acted the other characters.^[38]^[41]

   Hill contributed scripts for several first-season episodes (including
   the pilot)^[48]^[49]^[50]^[51] and was offered the role of story
   editor, but turned it downâ€”he would go on to pursue a career as a
   family film director.^[52]^[53] In his stead, Pete Burns was brought in
   for the job. Burns hailed from Chicago and had never met any of the
   principal players on SpongeBob before joining the team.^[40]

Pitching

     The execs from Nickelodeon flew out to Burbank, and we pitched it to
     them from the storyboards. We had squeezy toys, wore Hawaiian
     shirts, and used a boom box to play the Tiny Tim song ['Livin' in
     the Sunlight, Lovin' in the Moonlight'] that comes on in the third
     act. We really went all out in that pitch because we knew the pilot
     lived or died by if the execs laughed. When it was over, they walked
     out of the room to discuss it. We figured they would fly back to New
     York and we'd hear in a few weeks. We were surprised when they came
     back in what seemed like minutes and said they wanted to make it.

   â€”Derek Drymon^[40]

   While pitching the cartoon to Nickelodeon executives, Hillenburg donned
   a Hawaiian shirt, brought along an "underwater terrarium with models of
   the characters", and played Hawaiian music to set the theme. The setup
   was described by Nickelodeon executive Eric Coleman as "pretty
   amazing".^[34] They were given money and two weeks to write the pilot
   episode "Help Wanted".^[34] Drymon, Hillenburg, and Jennings returned
   with what was described by Nickelodeon official Albie Hecht as, "a
   performance [he] wished [he] had on tape".^[34] Although executive
   producer Derek Drymon described the pitch as stressful, he said it went
   "very well".^[34] Kevin Kay and Hecht had to step outside because they
   were "exhausted from laughing", which worried the cartoonists.^[34]

   In an interview, Cyma Zarghami, then-president of Nickelodeon, said,
   "their [Nickelodeon executives'] immediate reaction was to see it
   again, both because they liked it and it was unlike anything they'd
   ever seen before".^[54] Zarghami was one of four executives in the room
   when SpongeBob SquarePants was screened for the first time.^[54]

   Before commissioning the full series, Nickelodeon executives insisted
   that it would not be popular unless SpongeBob was a child who went to
   school, with his teacher as a main character.^[5] Hillenburg recalled
   in 2012 that Nickelodeon told him, "Our winning formula is animation
   about kids in school... We want you to put SpongeBob in school."^[29]
   Hillenburg was ready to "walk out" on Nickelodeon and abandon the
   series, since he wanted SpongeBob to be an adult character.^[29] He
   eventually compromised by adding a new character to the main cast, Mrs.
   Puff, who is a boat-driving teacher. Hillenburg was happy with the
   compromise and said, "A positive thing for me that came out of it was
   [how it brought] in a new character, Mrs. Puff, who I love."^[29]

Executive producers and showrunners

   Until his death in 2018, Hillenburg had served as the executive
   producer over the course of the series' entire history and functioned
   as its showrunner from its debut in 1999 until 2004. The series went on
   hiatus in 2002, after Hillenburg halted production on the show itself
   to work on the feature film The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie.^[44] Once
   the film was finalized and the third season finished, Hillenburg
   resigned as the series' showrunner. Although he no longer had a direct
   role in the series' production, he maintained an advisory role and
   reviewed each episode.^[54]^[55]

     It reached a point where I felt I'd contributed a lot and said what
     I wanted to say. At that point, the show needed new blood, and so I
     selected Paul [Tibbitt] to produce. I totally trusted him. I always
     enjoyed the way he captured the SpongeBob character's sense of
     humor. And as a writer, you have to move onâ€”I'm developing new
     projects.

   â€”Stephen Hillenburg, The Washington Post^[56]

   When the film was completed, Hillenburg intended it to be the series
   finale, "so [the show] wouldn't jump the shark." However, Nickelodeon
   wanted more episodes.^[57] Hillenburg appointed Paul Tibbitt, who had
   previously served on the show as a writer, director, and storyboard
   artist, to take over his role as showrunner to produce additional
   seasons.^[58] Hillenburg considered Tibbitt one of his favorite members
   of the show's crew,^[59] and "totally trusted him".^[56]

   On December 13, 2014, it was announced that Hillenburg would return to
   the series in an unspecified position.^[60] On November 26, 2018, at
   the age of 57, Hillenburg died from complications from amyotrophic
   lateral sclerosis (ALS), which he had been diagnosed with in March
   2017.^[61]^[62] Nickelodeon confirmed via Twitter the series would
   continue after his death.^[63] In February 2019, incoming president
   Brian Robbins vowed Nickelodeon would keep the show in production for
   as long as the network exists.^[64]

   As of the ninth season, former writers and storyboard directors Vincent
   Waller and Marc Ceccarelli act as showrunners.

Writing

   According to writer and storyboard artist Luke Brookshier, "SpongeBob
   is written differently to many television shows."^[65] Unlike most of
   its contemporaries, SpongeBob SquarePants does not use written
   scripts.^[65]^[66] Instead, storylines are developed by a team of five
   outline and premise writers. A two-page outline is then assigned to a
   team of storyboard directors, who produce a complete rough draft of the
   storyboard. One of the methods used to assemble storyboards was to use
   Post-it notes. Most of the dialogue and jokes are added during this
   stage.^[44]^[65] Brookshier has likened this process to how cartoons
   were made "in the early days of animation."^[65]

   The decision to eschew scripts for storyboards is one that Hillenburg
   made early in the series' development.^[44] Rocko's Modern Life had
   also used storyboarding derived from short outlines, and having worked
   on that series, Hillenburg felt strongly about adopting the process for
   SpongeBob SquarePantsâ€”even though Nickelodeon was beginning to show a
   greater preference for script-driven cartoons.^[40]^[67] Another
   series' writer, Merriwether Williams, explained in an interview that
   she and Mr. Lawrence would write a draft for an episode in an afternoon
   and be done at 4:00 pm.^[68]

   The writing staff often used their personal experiences as inspiration
   for the storylines of the series' episodes.^[40]^[56] For example, the
   episode "Sailor Mouth", where SpongeBob and Patrick learn
   profanity,^[56] was inspired by creative director Derek Drymon's
   experience as a child of getting into trouble for using the f-word in
   front of his mother.^[40] Drymon said, "The scene where Patrick is
   running to Mr. Krabs to tattle, with SpongeBob chasing him, is pretty
   much how it happened in real life".^[40] The end of the episode when
   Mr. Krabs uses even more profanity than SpongeBob and Patrick, was
   inspired "by the fact that my [Drymon's] mother has a sailor mouth
   herself".^[40] The idea for the episode "The Secret Box" also came from
   one of Drymon's childhood experiences.^[56]^[68] Hillenburg explained,
   "Drymon had a secret box [as a kid] and started telling us about it. We
   wanted to make fun of him and use it."^[56]

   Almost every episode is divided into two 11-minute segments. Hillenburg
   explained: "[I] never really wanted to deliberately try to write a
   half-hour show".^[56] He added, "I wrote the shows to where they felt
   right".^[56]

   Further information: List of SpongeBob SquarePants cast members and
   List of SpongeBob SquarePants guest stars

     Steve described SpongeBob to me as childlike and naÃ¯ve. He's not
     quite an adult, he's not quite a kid. Think a Stan Laurel, Jerry
     Lewis kind of child-man. Kind of like a Munchkin but not quite, kind
     of like a kid, but not in a Charlie Brown child's voice on the TV
     shows.

   â€”Tom Kenny^[41]

   SpongeBob SquarePants features the voices of: Tom Kenny, Bill
   Fagerbakke, Rodger Bumpass, Clancy Brown, Mr. Lawrence, Jill Talley,
   Carolyn Lawrence, Mary Jo Catlett, and Lori Alan. Most one-off and
   background characters are voiced by Dee Bradley Baker, Sirena Irwin,
   Bob Joles, Mark Fite and Thomas F. Wilson.

   Kenny voices SpongeBob and a number of other characters, including
   SpongeBob's pet snail Gary and the French narrator. He also physically
   portrays Patchy the Pirate in live-action segments of most special
   episodes. Kenny previously worked with Stephen Hillenburg on Rocko's
   Modern Life. When Hillenburg created SpongeBob SquarePants, he
   approached Kenny to voice the main character.^[69] Kenny originally
   used the voice of SpongeBob for a minor character on Rocko.^[43] He
   forgot how to perform the voice initially and did not intend to use it
   afterward. Hillenburg, however, used a video clip of the episode to
   remind Kenny of the voice.^[43] When Hillenburg heard Kenny perform the
   voice, he knew immediately he wanted it for his character. He said to
   Nickelodeon executives, "That's itâ€”I don't want to hear anybody else do
   the voice. We've got SpongeBob."^[41] The network insisted on
   auditioning more actors, but Hillenburg turned them down; in the words
   of Tom Kenny, "one of the advantages of having a strong creator is that
   the creator can say, 'No, I like thatâ€”I don't care about
   celebrities.'"^[41] While Kenny was developing SpongeBob's voice, the
   show's casting crew wanted him to have a unique, high-pitched laugh in
   the tradition of Popeye and Woody Woodpecker.^[70]

   Fagerbakke voices Patrick Star^[71] and other miscellaneous characters.
   At the same time when Hillenburg, Derek Drymon and Tim Hill were
   writing the pilot "Help Wanted", Hillenburg was also conducting
   auditions to find voices for the characters.^[40] Fagerbakke auditioned
   for the role of Patrick after Kenny had been cast.^[72] Fagerbakke
   recalled that during this audition, "Hillenburg actually played for me
   a portion of Tom [Kenny]'s performance [as SpongeBob], and they were
   looking for a counterpoint."^[72] In an interview, Fagerbakke compared
   himself to the character and said, "It's extremely gratifying".^[73]
   Whenever Patrick is angry Fagerbakke models his performance after
   American actress Shelley Winters.^[74]

   Squidward Tentacles is voiced by Rodger Bumpass, who describes him as
   "a very nasally, monotone kind of guy." He said the character "became a
   very interesting character to do" because of "his sarcasm, and then his
   frustration, and then his apoplexy, and so he became a wide spectrum of
   emotions".^[75] Arthur Brown, author of Everything I Need to Know, I
   Learned from Cartoons!, has compared Squidward's voice to that of Jack
   Benny's,^[76] a similarity Bumpass says is mostly unintentional.^[75]
   Voice acting veteran Clancy Brown voices Mr. Krabs, SpongeBob's boss at
   the Krusty Krab. Hillenburg modeled Mr. Krabs after his former manager
   at a seafood restaurant, whose strong Maine accent reminded Hillenburg
   of a pirate.^[77] Brown decided to use a "piratey" voice for the
   character with "a little Scottish brogue" after hearing Hillenburg's
   description of his boss.^[78] According to Brown, his Mr. Krabs voice
   was mostly improvised during his audition and it was not challenging
   for him to find the correct voice.^[78]

   Mr. Lawrence had met Hillenburg before on Rocko's Modern Life. While
   working on the pilot episode of SpongeBob, Hillenburg invited him to
   audition for all the characters.^[79] Since other voices had been found
   for the main cast already, Lawrence began by voicing a variety of minor
   characters. This included Plankton, who was initially only set to
   appear in one episode.^[79]^[40] Mr. Lawrence recalls that Nickelodeon
   executives told Hillenburg, "'we could stunt-cast this. You know, we
   could have Bruce Willis do this voice.' And Steve was just like, 'it's
   Doug [Lawrence], don't you hear it? This is the character! This is the
   guy!'"^[79] Jill Talley, Tom Kenny's wife, voices Karen Plankton.^[80]
   Being a Chicago native, she uses a Midwestern accent for the
   character.^[81] Electronic sound effects are underlaid by the series'
   audio engineers to create a robotic sound when she speaks.^[82] Talley
   and Mr. Lawrence often improvise Plankton and Karen's dialogue.
   Lawrence called improvisation his "favorite part of the voice over" in
   2009.^[83] He elaborated in a 2012 interview, saying, "I always enjoy
   the back-and-forth. [Talley and I] start to actually overlap so much
   talking to each other that [the voice directors] have to tell us, 'hey,
   stop doing that, separate what you're saying!'"^[79]

   Carolyn Lawrence voices Sandy Cheeks. She was in Los Feliz, Los
   Angeles, with a friend who knew SpongeBob SquarePants casting director
   Donna Grillo. Her friend said to Grillo that Lawrence had "an
   interesting voice". Grillo invited her to audition and she got the
   role.^[84]^[85] American actress Mary Jo Catlett,^[86] who is known for
   her live-action roles on television programs from the 1970s such as
   Diff'rent Strokes and M*A*S*H provides Mrs. Puff's voice.^[81] As of
   2017, voicing Mrs. Puff has become her only regular television role;
   Catlett described herself as "basically retired" in 2013, since she
   feels that voicing Mrs. Puff requires less preparation than her
   performances in person.^[87] Lori Alan voices Pearl Krabs.^[88] During
   her audition for the role, Alan was shown an early drawing of the
   characters and noted that Pearl was much larger than the rest of the
   cast. She decided to reflect the character's size in her voice by
   making it deep and full in tone. She aimed to make it invoke the sound
   of whales' low vocalizations while also sounding "spoiled and
   lovable."^[89] In an interview with AfterBuzz TV, Alan said she knew
   Pearl "had to sound somewhat like a child," but needed "an abnormally
   large voice."^[90]

   In addition to the regular cast, episodes feature guest voices from
   many professions, including actors, athletes, authors, musicians, and
   artists. Recurring guest voices include: Ernest Borgnine, who voiced
   Mermaid Man from 1999 until his death in 2012;^[91] Tim Conway as the
   voice of Barnacle Boy from 1999 until his death in 2019;^[92] Brian
   Doyle-Murray as the Flying Dutchman;^[93] and Marion Ross as Grandma
   SquarePants.^[94] Notable guests who have provided vocal cameo
   appearances include: David Bowie as Lord Royal Highness in the
   television film Atlantis SquarePantis;^[95]^[96] John Goodman as the
   voice of Santa in the episode "It's a SpongeBob Christmas!"; Johnny
   Depp as the voice of the surf guru, Jack Kahuna Laguna, in the episode
   "SpongeBob SquarePants vs. The Big One";^[97] and Victoria Beckham as
   the voice of Queen Amphitrite in the episode "The Clash of
   Triton".^[98]^[99]

   Voice recording sessions always include a full cast of actors, which
   Kenny describes as "getting more unusual".^[41] Kenny said, "That's
   another thing that's given SpongeBob its special feel. Everybody's in
   the same room, doing it old radio-show style. It's how the stuff we
   like was recorded".^[41] Series writer Jay Lender said, "The recording
   sessions were always fun ..."^[100] For the first three seasons,
   Hillenburg and Drymon sat in the recording studio and directed the
   actors.^[101] Andrea Romano became the voice director in the fourth
   season,^[101] and Tom Kenny took over the role during the ninth.
   Wednesday is recording day, the same schedule followed by the crew
   since 1999.^[101] Casting supervisor Jennie Monica Hammond said, "I
   loved Wednesdays".^[101]

  Animation

   Approximately 50 people work together to animate and produce an episode
   of SpongeBob SquarePants.^[65] Throughout its run, the series'
   production has been handled domestically at Nickelodeon Animation
   Studio in Burbank, California. The finished animation has been created
   overseas at Rough Draft Studios in South Korea.^[56]^[102] The
   California crew storyboard each episode. These are then used as
   templates by the crew in Korea,^[56] who animate each scene by hand,
   color each cel on computers, and paint backgrounds. Episodes are
   finished in California, where they are edited and have music
   added.^[65]

   During the first season, the series used cel animation.^[58] A shift
   was made the following year to digital ink and paint animation.^[58] In
   2009, executive producer Paul Tibbitt said: "The first season of
   SpongeBob was done the old-fashioned way on cells [sic], and every cell
   sic had to be part-painted, left to dry, paint some other colors. It's
   still a time-consuming aspect of the process now, but the digital way
   of doing things means it doesn't take long to correct".^[58]

   In 2008, the crew began using Wacom Cintiqs for the drawings instead of
   pencils. The fifth season episode "Pest of the West", one of the
   half-hour specials, was the first episode where the crew applied this
   method. Series' background designer Kenny Pittenger said, "The only
   real difference between the way we draw now and the way we drew then is
   that we abandoned pencil and paper during the fifth season".^[15] The
   shift to Wacom Cintiqs let the designers and animators draw on computer
   screens and make immediate changes or undo mistakes. Pittenger said,
   "Many neo-Ludditesâ€”er ... I mean, many of my cohortsâ€”don't like working
   on them, but I find them useful. There's no substitute for the
   immediacy of drawing on a piece of paper, of course, but digital
   nautical nonsense is still pretty fun".^[15]

   Illustration of the show's character models with SpongeBob on the left
   Screen Novelties created character models based on the works of
   Rankin/Bass for the show's stop-motion episodes.

   Since 2004, the SpongeBob crew has periodically collaborated with the
   LA-based animation studio Screen Novelties to create stop-motion
   sequences for special episodes. The studio produced a brief claymation
   scene for the climax of the first theatrical film.^[103] It was
   re-enlisted in 2009 to create an exclusive opening for the series'
   tenth anniversary special.^[104]^[105] The abominable snow mollusk, an
   octopus-like creature made of clay who acts as the antagonist of the
   double-length episode "Frozen Face-Off", was also animated by the
   company.^[106] Animation World Network reported that "within the
   SpongeBob creative team, there was always talk of doing a more involved
   project together" with Screen Novelties.^[106] As a result, the group
   was asked to create an episode animated entirely in stop motion in
   2011. This project became "It's a SpongeBob Christmas!",^[107] which
   reimagined the show's characters as if they were part of a Rankin/Bass
   holiday film.^[108] Tom Kenny, who is normally uninvolved in the
   writing process, contributed to the episode's plot; he said in 2012
   that he and Nickelodeon "wanted to do something just like those old
   school, stop-motion Rankin-Bass holiday specials ... which I watched
   over and over again when I was a kid growing up in Syracuse."^[103]
   Unconventional materials such as baking soda, glitter, wood chips and
   breakfast cereal were used in mass quantities to create the special's
   sets.^[109] Members of the Screen Novelties crew received one win and
   two nominations at the 30th Annie Awards,^[110] a nomination at the
   2013 Golden Reel Awards,^[111] and a nomination at the 2013 Annecy
   International Animated Film Festival for animating the episode.^[112]
   The team built a dolphin puppet named Bubbles, voiced by Matt Berry,
   for The SpongeBob Movie: Sponge Out of Water.^[113] Sequences involving
   Bubbles included a blend of stop motion and traditional animation. A
   second special animated in stop motion, themed around Halloween and
   using the same Rankin/Bass-inspired character models, was produced for
   season 11.^[114]^[115]

  Music

     [The music has gone] from mostly sea shanties and Hawaiian music Ã
     la Roy Smeck meets Pee-wee Hermanâ€”still the main style for the
     showâ€”in the early episodes, but it now includes film noir, West Side
     Story to [Henry] Mancini, Jerry Goldsmith and [Steven] Spielberg.
     There's Broadway-type scores and plain old goofy, loopy, weird
     stuff. I try to push the envelope on this show without getting in
     the way of the story, and I try to push it up and way over the top
     when I can get away with it, all the time keeping it as funny and
     ridiculous as possible.

   â€”Music editor Nicolas Carr^[116]

   Mark Harrison and Blaise Smith composed the SpongeBob SquarePants theme
   song.^[117] Its lyrics were written by Stephen Hillenburg and the
   series' original creative director Derek Drymon. The melody was
   inspired by the sea shanty "Blow the Man Down".^[35] An old oil
   painting of a pirate is used in the opening sequence. Dubbed "Painty
   the Pirate", according to Tom Kenny, Hillenburg found it in a thrift
   shop "years ago".^[43] Patrick Pinney voices Painty the Pirate, singing
   the theme song as the character.^[35] Hillenburg's lips were imposed
   onto the painting and move along with the lyrics.^[43] Kenny joked this
   is "about as close of a glimpse as most SpongeBob fans are ever going
   to get of Steve Hillenburg", because of his private nature.^[35]

   A cover of the song by Avril Lavigne can be found on the SpongeBob
   SquarePants Movie soundtrack.^[118]^[119] Another cover by the Violent
   Femmes aired on Nickelodeon as a promotion when the series moved to
   prime time.^[120]

   Steve Belfer, one of Hillenburg's friends from CalArts, wrote and
   performed the music heard over the end credits.^[40] This theme
   includes ukulele music at Hillenburg's request.^[40] Drymon said, "It's
   so long ago, it's hard to be sure, but I remember Hillenburg having the
   Belfer music early on, maybe before the pilot".^[40]

   The series' music editor and main composer is Nicolas Carr.^[116] After
   working with Hillenburg on Rocko's Modern Life, he struggled to find a
   new job in his field. He had considered a career change before
   Hillenburg offered him the job. The first season's score primarily
   featured selections from the Associated Production Music Library, which
   Carr has said includes "lots of great old corny Hawaiian music and big,
   full, dramatic orchestral scores."^[116] Rocko's Modern Life also used
   music from this library. It was Hillenburg's decision to adopt this
   approach. Carr has described the selections for SpongeBob SquarePants
   as being "more over-the-top" than those for Rocko's Modern Life.^[116]

   Hillenburg felt it was important for the series to develop its own
   music library, consisting of scores that could be reused and re-edited
   throughout the years. He wanted these scores to be composed by
   unknowns, and a group of twelve was assembled. They formed "The Sponge
   Divers Orchestra", which includes Carr and Belfer. The group went on to
   provide most of the music for later seasons, although Carr still draws
   from the Associated Production Music Library, as well as another
   library that he founded himselfâ€”Animation Music Inc.^[116]

  Tenth anniversary

     Ten years. I never imagined working on the show to this date and
     this long...I really figured we might get a season and a cult
     following, and that might be it.

   â€”Stephen Hillenburg^[122]

   Nickelodeon began celebrating the series' 10th anniversary on January
   18, 2009, with a live cast reading of the episode "SpongeBob vs. The
   Big One". The readingâ€”a first for the seriesâ€”was held at that year's
   Sundance Film Festival.^[123]^[124] The episode, which premiered on TV
   on April 17, 2009, features Johnny Depp as a guest star.^[125] Other
   celebratory actions taken by the network included the launching of a
   new website for the series (spongebob.com) and the introduction of new
   merchandise. A "SpongeBob and water conservation-themed element" was
   also added to Nickelodeon's pro-social campaign The Big Green
   Help.^[123] In an interview, Tom Kenny said, "What I'm most proud of is
   that kids still really like [SpongeBob SquarePants] and care about
   it ... They eagerly await new episodes. People who were young children
   when it started 10 years ago are still watching it and digging it and
   think it's funny. That's the loving cup for me."^[126]

   Three nights before the official anniversary date, an hour-long
   documentary on the series, Square Roots: The Story of SpongeBob
   SquarePants, premiered on VH1.^[122]^[123]^[124]^[126]^[127] Critically
   acclaimed duo Patrick Creadon and Christine O'Malley created the film
   as a followup to I.O.U.S.A.â€”a documentary on America's financial
   situation. Creadon remarked, "After spending two years examining the
   financial health of the United States, Christine and I were ready to
   tackle something a little more upbeat. Telling the SpongeBob story
   feels like the perfect fit."^[123] On Friday, July 17, Nickelodeon
   marked the official anniversary of the series, with a 50-hour
   television marathon titled "The Ultimate SpongeBob SpongeBash Weekend".
   It began with a new episode, "To SquarePants or Not to SquarePants".
   Saturday saw a countdown of the top ten episodes as picked by fans, as
   well as an airing of The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie. The marathon
   finished on Sunday, with a countdown of episodes picked by celebrities
   and the premiere of ten new episodes.^[123]^[128]^[129]

   Nickelodeon continued celebrating the anniversary through the rest of
   the year. An eight-episode DVD set featuring To SquarePants or Not to
   SquarePants was released shortly after the marathon on July
   21.^[130]^[131] Next a 2,200 minute, 14-disc DVD set titled The First
   100 Episodes was released on September 22.^[131]^[132]^[133] Finally,
   on November 6, an hour-long television film, titled Truth or Square,
   debuted on Nickelodeon. The film is narrated by Ricky Gervais and
   features live action cameo appearances by: Rosario Dawson, Craig
   Ferguson, Will Ferrell, Tina Fey, LeBron James, P!nk, Triumph the
   Insult Comic Dog, and Robin Williams.^[134]^[135]^[136] It was released
   as part of a five-episode DVD set on November 10, 2009.^[137]

  Twentieth anniversary

   On February 11, 2019, Nickelodeon announced it would recognize the
   twentieth anniversary of SpongeBob SquarePants with a series of
   celebrations known as the "Best Year Ever".^[138]^[139] In honor of the
   anniversary, Pantone created color shades known as "SpongeBob
   SquarePants Yellow" and "Patrick Star Pink" to be used by Nickelodeon's
   licensing partners.^[140]^[141]^[142] Romero Britto, Jon Burgerman, and
   the Filipino art collective Secret Fresh were commissioned by
   Nickelodeon to create art pieces devoted to SpongeBob SquarePants. Some
   of these pieces were to be adapted into commercial
   products.^[140]^[141] On February 12, in conjunction with Nickelodeon's
   announcement of the "Best Year Ever", Cynthia Rowley presented a
   SpongeBob SquarePants-themed wetsuit during New York Fashion
   Week.^[143]^[144]^[145] A month later, Marlou Breuls presented the
   SpongeBob SquarePants-themed "Icon Collection" during Amsterdam Fashion
   Week.^[146]^[147] That summer, Nike, in collaboration with Kyrie
   Irving, released a SpongeBob SquarePants series of shoes, accessories,
   and apparel.^[148] In July, for the first time ever, SpongeBob
   SquarePants became the theme of a cosmetics line, which was released as
   a limited time offering by HipDot Studios.^[143]^[149]^[150] The "Best
   Year Ever" also introduced an official SpongeBob SquarePants YouTube
   channel and a new mobile game based on the series, along with new toy
   lines.^[142]^[143]

   The "Best Year Ever" formally began on July 12, 2019, with the premiere
   of the one-hour, live-action/animated TV special SpongeBob's Big
   Birthday Blowout.^[138]^[139]^[151] It continued that month at San
   Diego Comic Con, with two panels, a booth, and various activities
   devoted to the series.^[142]^[152] The "Best Year Ever" was recognized
   on Amazon Prime Day with an exclusive early release of SpongeBob
   SquarePants: The Best 200 Episodes Ever!, a 30-disc DVD compilation of
   two box sets, SpongeBob SquarePants: The First 100 Episodes and
   SpongeBob SquarePants: The Next 100 Episodes. The collections received
   a standard nationwide release on August 27.^[153] The "Best Year Ever"
   continued into 2020 culminating with the August 14 release of The
   SpongeBob Movie: Sponge on the Run.^[138]^[139]^[154]

Reception

  Ratings and run-length achievements

   Within its first month on air, SpongeBob SquarePants overtook PokÃ©mon
   as the highest rated Saturday-morning children's series on television.
   It held an average national Nielsen rating of 4.9 among children aged
   two through eleven, denoting 1.9 million viewers.^[155]^[156] Two years
   later, the series had firmly established itself as Nickelodeon's second
   highest-rated children's program, after Rugrats. SpongeBob SquarePants
   was credited with helping Nickelodeon take the "Saturday-morning
   ratings crown" for the fourth straight season in 2001.^[157] The series
   had gained a significant adult audience by that pointâ€”nearly 40 percent
   of its 2.2 million viewers were aged 18 to 34.^[158] In response to its
   weekend success, Nickelodeon gave SpongeBob SquarePants time slots at
   6:00 PM and 8:00 PM, Monday through Thursday, to increase the series'
   exposure.^[158]^[159] By the end of 2001, SpongeBob SquarePants boasted
   the highest ratings for any children's series, on all of
   television.^[160]^[161]^[162] Weekly viewership of the series had
   reached around fifteen million, at least five million of whom were
   adults.^[160]

   In October 2002, another Nickelodeon series, The Fairly OddParents,
   ranked as the number two program for children between two and eleven
   years old.^[163] Its ratings at that time were almost equal to
   SpongeBob SquarePants' then-average of 2.2 million viewers per
   episode.^[163] The Fairly OddParents even briefly surpassed SpongeBob
   SquarePants, causing it to drop into second place. At this time, The
   Fairly OddParents had a 6.2 rating and nearly 2.5 million child
   viewers, while SpongeBob SquarePants had a 6.0 rating and 2.4 million
   child viewers aged two to eleven.^[164] Nickelodeon "recognized" The
   Fairly OddParents for its climbing ratings and installed it in a new
   8:00 PM time slot, previously occupied by SpongeBob SquarePants.^[163]
   In an interview, Cyma Zarghami, then-general manager and executive vice
   president of Nickelodeon, said, "Are we banking on the fact that Fairly
   OddParents will be the next SpongeBob? ... We are hoping. But SpongeBob
   is so unique, it's hard to say if it will ever be repeated."^[163]

   In 2012, however, the series' ratings were declining.^[165]^[166] The
   average number of viewers aged two to eleven watching SpongeBob at any
   given time dropped 29% in the first quarter from a year earlier,
   according to Nielsen. Wall Street Journal business writer John
   Jannarone suggested the series' age and oversaturation might be
   contributing to its ratings' decline and might also be directly
   responsible for the decline in Nickelodeon's overall ratings.^[167]
   Media analyst Todd Juenger attributed the decline in Nickelodeon's
   ratings directly to the availability of streaming video content on
   services like Netflix, a provider of on-demand Internet streaming
   media.^[168]

   Philippe Dauman, the president and CEO of Viacom, contradicted that
   notion, saying: "We are getting nice revenues through these
   subscription VOD deals", adding Netflix only has "some library content"
   on its service.^[169]^[170] A Nickelodeon spokesman said, "SpongeBob is
   performing consistently well and remains the number one rated animated
   series in all of children's television."^[167] He added, "There is
   nothing that we have seen that points to SpongeBob as a problem."^[167]
   Dauman blamed the drop on "some ratings systemic issues" at Nielsen,
   citing extensive set-top-box data that "does in no way reflect" the
   Nielsen data.^[171]

   Juenger noted SpongeBob could affect the ratings of other Nickelodeon
   programming because children often change channels to find their
   favorite programs, then stay tuned to that network.^[167] Nickelodeon
   reduced its^[clarification needed] exposure on television. In the first
   quarter of 2012, the network cut back on the number of episodes it
   aired by 16% compared to a year earlier.^[167]

   On April 22, 2013, Netflix CEO Reed Hastings announced their intentions
   not to renew their existing deal with Viacom.^[172] Viacom's deal with
   Netflix expired, and shows such as SpongeBob and Dora the Explorer were
   removed.^[173] However, seasons five through eight of SpongeBob are
   still available to stream on Netflix in Canada.^[174] On June 4, 2013,
   Viacom announced a multi-year licensing agreement which would move its
   programs, such as SpongeBob and Dora the Explorer, to Amazon.com,
   Netflix's top competitor.^[175]^[176] Amazon agreed to pay more than
   $200 million to Viacom for the license, its largest subscription
   streaming transaction ever.^[177]^[178]

   SpongeBob SquarePants is one of the longest-running series on
   Nickelodeon.^[179] It became the network's series with the most
   episodes during its eighth season, surpassing the 172 episodes of
   Rugrats.^[180] In the ninth season, its 26 episodes brought the number
   of episodes produced to 204.^[181]^[182]^[183] In a statement, Brown
   Johnson, Nickelodeon's animation president said, "SpongeBob's success
   in reaching over 200 episodes is a testament to creator Stephen
   Hillenburg's vision, comedic sensibility and his dynamic, lovable
   characters. The series now joins the club of contemporary classic
   Nicktoons that have hit this benchmark, so we're incredibly
   proud."^[184]^[185]

  Critical reception

   SpongeBob SquarePants has been widely praised particularly for its
   appeal to different age groups, and the show has earned numerous awards
   and accolades throughout its run. James Poniewozik of Time magazine
   described the title character as "the anti-Bart Simpson,
   temperamentally and physically: his head is as squared-off and neat as
   Bart's is unruly, and he has a personality to matchâ€”conscientious,
   optimistic and blind to the faults in the world and those around
   him."^[186] According to Laura Fries of Variety magazine, the series is
   "a thoughtful and inventive cartoon about a hopelessly optimistic and
   resilient sea sponge ... Devoid of the double entendres rife in today's
   animated TV shows, this is purely kid's stuff. ... However, that's not
   to say that SpongeBob is simplistic or even juvenile. It's charming and
   whimsical, but clever enough to appeal to teens and college-aged kids,
   as well."^[187] The New York Times' critic Joyce Millman said SpongeBob
   "is clever without being impenetrable to young viewers and goofy
   without boring grown-ups to tears. It's the most charming toon on
   television, and one of the weirdest. And it's also good, clean fun,
   which makes sense because it is, after all, about a sponge." Millman
   wrote, "His relentless good cheer would be irritating if he weren't so
   darned lovable and his world so excellently strange. ... Like Pee-wee's
   Playhouse, SpongeBob joyfully dances on the fine line between childhood
   and adulthood, guilelessness and camp, the warped and the sweet."^[188]

   Robert Thompson, a professor of communications and director of the
   Center for the Study of Popular Television at Syracuse University, told
   The New York Times

     There is something kind of unique about [SpongeBob]. It seems to be
     a refreshing breath from the pre-irony era. There's no sense of the
     elbow-in-rib, tongue-in-cheek aesthetic that so permeates the rest
     of American cultureâ€”including kids' shows like the Rugrats. I think
     what's subversive about it is it's so incredibly naiveâ€”deliberately.
     Because there's nothing in it that's trying to be hip or cool or
     anything else, hipness can be grafted onto it.^[189]

   In another interview with Los Angeles Times, he commentated on the
   show's adult audience: "[On one hand] It's a kind of time machine that
   transports parents back to when they watched TV in their footie
   [pajamas]. On the other hand, it's very hip in the way it's presented.
   It is very edgy to adults who know how to read and listen between the
   frames."^[190] Television critics Alan Sepinwall and Matt Zoller Seitz
   ranked SpongeBob SquarePants as the 22nd greatest American TV series of
   all time in their 2016 book TV (The Book).^[191] In a 2007 interview,
   Barack Obama said SpongeBob is his favorite TV character and admitted
   that SpongeBob SquarePants is "the show I watch with my
   daughters."^[192]^[193]^[194]

  Awards and accolades

   Main article: List of awards and nominations received by SpongeBob
   SquarePants

   SpongeBob SquarePants has received many awards and nominations; among
   these are four Emmy Awards (Outstanding Special Class Animated Program
   in 2010;^[195] Outstanding Sound Editing â€“ Animation" in 2014;^[196]
   Outstanding Children's Animated Series in 2018; and Outstanding
   Performer in an Animated Program in 2018 for Kenny);^[197] six Annie
   Awards;^[198]^[199]^[200]^[201]^[202] and two BAFTA Children's
   Awards.^[203]^[204] In 2006, IGN ranked SpongeBob SquarePants 15th on
   its list, Top 25 Animated Series of All Time,^[205] and in 2013, it
   ranked the series 12th on its list, The Top 25 Animated Series for
   Adults.^[206] In addition, the website's UK division ran a Top 100
   Animated Series list, and like its US counterpart, ranked SpongeBob
   SquarePants 15th.^[207]

   TV Guide listed SpongeBob SquarePants himself at number nine on its
   list 50 Greatest Cartoon Characters of All Time in 2002.^[208] In June
   2010, Entertainment Weekly named SpongeBob one of the 100 Greatest
   Characters of the Last 20 Years.^[209] Viewers of UK television network
   Channel 4 voted SpongeBob SquarePants the 28th Greatest Cartoon in a
   2004 poll.^[210]^[211] The series is among the All-TIME 100 TV Shows as
   chosen by Time television critic James Poniewozik in 2007. He said,
   "It's the most funny, surreal, inventive example of the explosion in
   creative kids' (and adult) entertainment that Nick, Cartoon Network and
   their ilk made possible."^[212] In 2013, the publication ranked
   SpongeBob SquarePants the eighth Greatest TV Cartoon of All Time.^[213]
   Television critic Matt Zoller Seitz included the series in his 2016
   book with Alan Sepinwall titled TV (The Book) as the 22nd greatest
   American television series of all time, saying that "SpongeBob
   SquarePants is an absurdist masterpiece that Salvador DalÃ­ and Groucho
   Marx would have watched together in their smoking jackets".^[214]^[215]

   SpongeBob became the first animated character sculpted entirely out of
   wax.^[216]^[217]^[218]^[219]

   The character has also become a trend in Egypt at Cairo's Tahrir
   Square.^[220] After the Egyptian Revolution of 2011, SpongeBob became a
   fashion phenomenon, appearing on various merchandise items from hijabs
   to boxer shorts.^[221]^[222] The phenomenon led to the creation of the
   Tumblr project called "SpongeBob on the Nile". The project was founded
   by American students Andrew Leber and Elisabeth Jaquette and attempts
   to document every appearance of SpongeBob in Egypt.^[223] Sherief
   Elkeshta cited the phenomenon in an essay about the incoherent state of
   politics in Egypt in an independent monthly paper titled Midan Masr. He
   wrote, "Why isn't he [SpongeBob] at least holding a Molotov cocktail?
   Or raising a fist?"^[224] The phenomenon has even spread to Libya,
   where a Libyan rebel in SpongeBob dress was photographed celebrating
   the revolution.^[225] Although The Guardian and Vice have asserted that
   the trend has little to no political significance,^[220]^[221] "joke"
   presidential campaigns have been undertaken for SpongeBob in Egypt and
   Syria.^[221]^[223]

   A clip was posted to YouTube in February 2013 that features soldiers in
   the Russian army and navy singing the SpongeBob SquarePants theme song
   as they march.^[226]^[227] According to the website that uploaded the
   video, this is one of the "most popular marching songs" in the Russian
   military.^[226] The video garnered nearly 50,000 views within its first
   week.^[227]

   Following Hillenburg's death in November 2018, more than 1.2 million
   fans signed a petition for the National Football League to have the
   song "Sweet Victory" from the season 2 episode "Band Geeks" performed
   in his honor at the Super Bowl LIII halftime show. Atlanta's
   Mercedes-Benz Stadium's Twitter account, the venue of the show, tweeted
   a GIF of SpongeBob dancing in "Band Geeks" in December. Maroon 5 who
   were performing at the game, included a brief clip of SpongeBob in a
   preview video, leading fans to believe the song would be performed.
   While the song's opening was ultimately included, it served as a
   transition into artist Travis Scott's set, which left many fans
   disappointed.^[228]^[229] In response to fans' disappointment at not
   hearing the complete "Sweet Victory" song during the halftime show at
   the Super Bowl LIII, the Dallas Stars of the National Hockey League
   showed a clip of the full "Sweet Victory" song during a game at the
   American Airlines Center. In the clip, the characters' band uniforms
   are recolored green after the Stars.^[230]^[231]

   Several species of organism have been named in reference to SpongeBob.
   In May 2011, a new species of mushroom, Spongiforma squarepantsii, was
   described and named after the series' title character.^[232] In 2019, a
   species of sea sponge, Clathria hillenburgi, was named in honor of
   Hillenburg, also referencing his creation of SpongeBob
   SquarePants.^[233] In 2020, a species of abyssal sea star, Astrolirus
   patricki, was described and named after Patrick Star; individuals of
   this species were found to be closely associated with hexactinellid
   sponges, and it was thus named after Patrick as a reference to the
   character's friendship with SpongeBob.^[234]

   In honor of Stephen Hillenburg, a non-profit fan project, titled The
   SpongeBob SquarePants Movie Rehydrated, was released online on May 1,
   2022. It consists of a recreation of The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie
   reanimated by 300 people with re-recorded music and dialogue. Amid the
   YouTube premiere, the video was taken down by Paramount Global due to
   copyright laws. As a result, the hashtag #JusticeForSpongeBob became
   trending on Twitter against Paramount's action. The video was restored
   the following day.^[235]^[236]

Criticism

  Controversies

    Sexuality

   In 2005, an online video that showed clips from SpongeBob SquarePants
   and other children's shows set to the Sister Sledge song "We Are
   Family" to promote diversity and tolerance was attacked by an
   evangelical group in the United States. They saw SpongeBob being used
   to "advocate homosexuality".^[237]^[238] James Dobson of Focus on the
   Family accused the video of promoting homosexuality because it was
   sponsored by a pro-tolerance group.^[238] The incident prompted the
   question whether SpongeBob is gay. Although the character has enjoyed
   popularity with gay viewers, series creator Stephen Hillenburg had
   already denied SpongeBob is gay three years earlier, clarifying at the
   time he considered the character to be "somewhat asexual".^[239] After
   Dobson's comments, Hillenburg reasserted his position, stating that
   sexual preference does not play a part in what they are "trying to do"
   with the series.^[240]^[241] Tom Kenny and other production members
   were distraught that the issue had arisen.^[43] Dobson later said his
   comments were taken out of context and his original complaints were not
   with SpongeBob, the video, or any of the characters in the video, but
   rather with the organization that sponsored the video, the We Are
   Family Foundation. Dobson said they posted pro-gay material on their
   website, but later removed it.^[242] After the controversy, John H.
   Thomas, the United Church of Christ's general minister and president,
   said they would welcome SpongeBob into their ministry. He said: "Jesus
   didn't turn people away. Neither do we."^[243]

   Queer theorist Jeffery P. Dennis, author of the journal article
   "Queertoons", argued that SpongeBob and Sandy are not romantically in
   love, but added he believed SpongeBob and Patrick "are paired with
   arguably erotic intensity".^[244] Martin Goodman of Animation World
   Magazine called Dennis' comments regarding SpongeBob and Patrick
   "interesting".^[245]^[d] Ukrainian website Family Under the Protection
   of the Holy Virgin, which has been described as a "fringe Catholic"
   group by The Wall Street Journal, criticized SpongeBob SquarePants for
   its alleged "promotion of homosexuality".^[247] The group sought to
   have the series banned, along with several other popular children's
   properties. The National Expert Commission of Ukraine on the Protection
   of Public Morality took up the matter for review in August 2012.^[247]
   Questions of SpongeBob's sexuality resurfaced in 2020 after
   Nickelodeon's official Twitter account posted an image of the
   character, in rainbow colors with text celebrating the LGBTQ+ community
   and its allies during Pride Month. Although the post did not make any
   assertions about SpongeBob's sexual orientation, numerous users
   responded on social media, claiming they already had their suspicions
   that he might be gay or reasserting Hillenburg's description of
   asexuality.^[248]

   In April 2009, Burger King released a SpongeBob-themed advertisement
   featuring a parody of Sir Mix-a-Lot's song "Baby Got Back". The
   Campaign for a Commercial-Free Childhood protested the ad for being
   sexist and inappropriately sexual, especially considering SpongeBob's
   fan base includes young children.^[249]^[250]^[251]^[252]^[253] In
   official statements released by Burger King and Nickelodeon, both
   companies claimed the campaign was aimed at parents.^[252]^[253]

    Other

     "The children who watched the cartoon were operating at half the
     capacity compared to other children."

   â€”Angeline S. Lillard, University of Virginia^[254]

   A 2011 study conducted at the University of Virginia, published in the
   journal Pediatrics, suggested that allowing preschool-aged audiences to
   watch the series caused short-term disruptions in mental function and
   attention span because of frequent shot changes, compared to control
   groups watching Caillou and drawing pictures.^[255]^[256] A Nickelodeon
   executive responded in an interview the series was not intended for an
   audience of that age and that the study used "questionable methodology
   and could not possibly provide the basis for any valid findings that
   parents could trust."^[257]^[258]

   Several of the series' episodes have also been the subject of
   controversy. In a report titled "Wolves in Sheep's Clothing", which
   documents the increase in potentially violent, profane, and sexual
   content in children's programming, the Parents Television Council, a
   watchdog media group, claimed the season 2 SpongeBob SquarePants
   episode "Sailor Mouth" was an implicit attempt to promote and satirize
   use of profanity among children.^[259] "SpongeBob's Last Stand" (season
   7) and "Selling Out" (season 4) have been criticized for promoting
   environmentalism and left-wing politics because of their negative
   portrayal of big business.^[260] "SpongeBob, You're Fired" (season 9)
   caused widespread controversy and sparked a political debate over its
   portrayal of unemployment;^[260] after Fox News and the New York Post
   commented on the episode, Media Matters for America accused the two
   organizations of using the episode to "attack the social safety
   net."^[261] This statement was echoed by Al Sharpton, who claimed
   conservatives' "new hero" to be "a sponge who lives in a pineapple
   under the sea."^[262] In 2014, the education minister of Kazakhstan,
   Zabira Orazalieva, deemed the show too violent for children, labeling
   the titular character a "self-absorbed hooligan"^[263] who "regularly
   inflicts violence on others in his community and seems to enjoy what he
   does."^[264]^[265]

   In 2019, University of Washington professor Holly M. Barker stated that
   the show promotes "violent and racist" colonialism, since Bikini Bottom
   is named after Bikini Atoll, a place where natives were resettled by
   the US government for nuclear testing. Barker also pointed out that
   cultural appropriation of Pacific culture in the show. Because of such
   content, children have "become acculturated to an ideology that
   includes the U.S. character SpongeBob residing on another peopleâ€™s
   homeland", according to Barker.^[266] ViacomCBS eventually pulled the
   episode "Mid-Life Crustacean" (season 3), first aired in 2003, out of
   circulation in March 2021, presumably due to its ending in which
   SpongeBob, Patrick, and Mr. Krabs partake in a panty raid. "We
   determined some story elements were not kid-appropriate", a Nickelodeon
   representative stated. A later episode, "Kwarantined Krab" (season 12),
   was also made unavailable for release, over its similarities to the
   COVID-19 pandemic.^[267]

  Allegations of declining quality

   This section needs to be updated. Please help update this article to
   reflect recent events or newly available information. (May 2018)

   Various media outlets including MSN, The A.V. Club, and Vulture have
   reported that SpongeBob's popularity declined following the release of
   the 2004 film and Hillenburg's departure as
   showrunner.^[268]^[269]^[270] In 2012, MSN cited a post on Encyclopedia
   SpongeBobia, a Fandom-hosted wiki, which said that many fans felt the
   series had "jumped the shark" following the release of The SpongeBob
   SquarePants Movie and that online fansites were becoming
   "deserted."^[268]

   As of 2011, episodes produced since the first film have been variously
   categorized by DVD Talk and DVD Verdict as "tedious;"^[271] "boring"
   and "dreck;"^[272] a "depressing plateau of mediocrity;"^[273] and
   "laugh-skimpy."^[274] In 2018, Vulture noted the most popular online
   memes of the series usually focused on episodes from the first three
   seasons.^[270] That same year, The A.V. Club wrote that as the series
   went on, "[it] leaned hard into kid-friendly physical humor and gross
   out moments that appealed to no one in particular".^[269]

   Nickelodeon faced criticism from fans and former staff like Paul
   Tibbitt when the network greenlit spinoffs (see below) after the death
   of Hillenburg, who had previously expressed hesitation in deriving from
   the parent series. "The show is about SpongeBob, he's the core element,
   and it's about how he relates to the other characters," Hillenburg told
   Television Business International. "Patrick by himself might be a bit
   too much. So I don't see any spin-offs."^[275]

   Main article: Kamp Koral: SpongeBob's Under Years

   On February 14, 2019, it was announced that a SpongeBob SquarePants
   spin-off is in development.^[139] On June 4, it was announced the
   spinoff will be titled Kamp Koral. The plot will focus on a 10-year-old
   SpongeBob and his friends at the titular camp located in the Kelp
   Forest, where they spend the summer catching jellyfish, building
   campfires, and swimming in Lake Yuckymuck.^[276]^[277] It serves as a

   Run.^[277] It was confirmed production of the series began in June
   2019.^[139]^[276]

   Nickelodeon animation head Ramsey Naito said of the series, "SpongeBob
   has an incredible universe to expand upon and the greenlight for Kamp
   Koral is a testament to the strength and longevity of these characters
   known and loved by generations of fans around the world." Like
   SpongeBob SquarePants, the series is co-executive produced by Marc
   Ceccarelli, Jennie Monica, and Vincent Waller. Kamp Koral is produced
   using computer animation rather than the digital ink and paint
   animation used for SpongeBob SquarePants.^[277]

   On February 19, 2020, it was announced that the series had an official
   title of Kamp Koral: SpongeBob's Under Years, and would be premiering

  Comic books

   Main article: SpongeBob Comics

   The 32-page bimonthly comic book series, SpongeBob Comics, was
   announced in November 2010^[328] and debuted the following
   February.^[329] Before this, SpongeBob SquarePants comics had been
   published in Nickelodeon Magazine,^[328]^[330]^[331] and episodes of
   the television series had been adapted by Cine-Manga,^[328]^[332] but
   SpongeBob Comics was the first American comic book series devoted
   solely to SpongeBob SquarePants.^[328]^[330]^[331] It also served as
   SpongeBob SquarePants creator Stephen Hillenburg's debut as a comic
   book author.^[329]^[330]^[331] The series was published by Hillenburg's
   production company, United Plankton Pictures, and distributed by Bongo
   Comics Group.^[328]^[330]^[331] Hillenburg described the stories from
   the comic books as "original and always true to the humor, characters,
   and universe of the SpongeBob SquarePants series." Leading up to the
   release of the series, Hillenburg said, "I'm hoping that fans will
   enjoy finally having a SpongeBob comic book from me."^[330]^[331]

   Chris Duffy, the former senior editor of Nickelodeon Magazine, serves
   as managing editor of SpongeBob Comics.^[330]^[331] Hillenburg and
   Duffy met with various cartoonistsâ€”including James Kochalka, Hilary
   Barta, Graham Annable, Gregg Schigiel, and Jacob Chabotâ€”to contribute
   to each issues.^[330]^[331] Retired horror comics writer and artist
   Stephen R. Bissette returned to write a special Halloween issue in
   2012, with Tony Millionaire and Al Jaffee.^[333] In an interview with
   Tom Spurgeon, Bissette said, "I've even broken my retirement to do one
   work-for-hire gig [for SpongeBob Comics] so I could share everything
   about that kind of current job."^[334]

   In the United Kingdom, Titan Magazines published comics based on
   SpongeBob SquarePants every four weeks from February 3, 2005,^[335]
   through November 28, 2013.^[336] Titan Magazines also teamed up with
   Lego to release a limited edition SpongeBob-themed comic.^[337]

   was released in theaters on February 6, 2015.^[346] The series' main
   cast members reprised their roles.^[347] The underwater parts are
   animated traditionally in the manner of the seriesâ€”the live-action
   parts use CGI animation with the SpongeBob characters.^[348]^[349] The
   film has a budget similar to the previous film and cost less than $100
   million to produce.^[350]^[351]^[352]

   On April 30, 2015, Viacom announced a third film was in
   development.^[353] In April 2018, Tim Hill was named as director, and
   the film's original title, It's a Wonderful Sponge, was revealed.
   Paramount originally scheduled a release date of July 17, 2020, later
   moving it earlier to May 22, 2020.^[354] In October 2018, it was
   announced the movie will be an origin story of how SpongeBob came to
   Bikini Bottom and how he got his square pants. Around the same time, it
   was announced that Hans Zimmer will compose the music. The first poster
   along with a title change to Sponge on the Run was revealed on November
   12, 2019,^[355] with the first trailer releasing on November 14.^[356]
   The film was later delayed to July 31, 2020 (and later August 7, 2020)
   due to the COVID-19 pandemic.^[357]^[154] The film's worldwide
   theatrical release was later cancelled in June 2020 and it was
   announced that it would be released in Canadian theaters on August 14,
   2020, followed by a release on premium video on demand before heading
   to Paramount+ in early 2021.^[358]^[359] On January 28, 2021, it was
   announced that the film would be released on the service on March 4,
   2021.^[281]

   series for the streaming service.^[362]

   On August 24, 2021, Brian Robbins, CEO of Nickelodeon, has stated that

   respectively.^[365]^[366]

   Several songs have been recorded for the purpose of a single or album
   release, and have not been featured on the show. The song "My Tidy
   Whities" written by Tom Kenny and Andy Paley was released only on the
   album The Best Day Ever (2006). Kenny's inspiration for the song was
   "underwear humor,"^[367] saying: "Underwear humor is always a surefire
   laugh-getter with kids ... Just seeing a character that odd wearing
   really prosaic, normal, Kmart, three-to-a-pack underwear is a funny
   drawing ... We thought it was funny to make a really lush, beautiful
   love song to his underwear."^[367]

   A soundtrack album The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie â€“ Music from the
   Movie and More..., featuring the film's score was released along with
   the feature-length film in November 2004. Various artists including the

  Theater

   Main article: SpongeBob SquarePants (musical)

   SpongeBob SquarePants was adapted as a stage musical in 2016 by
   director Tina Landau. SpongeBob SquarePants, The Broadway Musical
   premiered in Chicago in 2016 and opened on Broadway at the Palace
   Theatre on December 4, 2017.^[405] The musical opened to critical
   acclaim,^[406] and tied for most-nominated production at the 2018 72nd
   Tony Awards with twelve Tony nominations.^[407]

SpongeBob in internet culture

   Online memes relating to SpongeBob SquarePants have achieved widespread
   popularity on the Internet, so much so that Vox's Aja Romano declared
   in 2019 that "Spongebob memes came to rule internet culture."^[408] A
   subreddit devoted to memes based on the animated series has, as of May
   2019, accumulated over 1.7 million subscribers, a figure exponentially
   higher than subreddits devoted to the series itself.^[408]

   Matt Schimkowitz, a senior editor for Know Your Meme, told Time that a
   combination of factors make SpongeBob memes so popular. He speculated
   that nostalgia for the past, alongside the cartoon's young audience,
   contributed to the SpongeBob Squarepants's outsized presence in
   Internet meme culture. Schimkowitz further added that memes derived
   from the series are exceptionally good at expressing emotions.^[409]

   Michael Gold of The New York Times concurred. The writer opined that
   because of the show's "high episode count" and that it was "so
   ubiquitous at the beginning of the 21st century," SpongeBob SquarePants
   became "easy meme fodder."^[410]

   Nickelodeon and members of the SpongeBob cast have expressed approval
   for the trend. Tom Kenny told Time that he found SpongeBob memes
   relatable and good-natured. Kenny said that while the show's characters
   can be considered complex, they are also simple, creating a wealth of
   content for meme creators to work with.^[citation needed] Nickelodeon
   has manufactured a line of toys based on some of the show's most
   recognizable meme formats,^[408] and has even included references to
   well-known memes in video games.^[411]

   Among the show's most popular memes are the mocking SpongeBob meme,
   referring to an image macro from the episode, "Little Yellow Book,"
   ^[412] a screenshot of a surprised Patrick Star from the SpongeBob
   SquarePants Movie,^[413] an image of Spongebob appearing exhausted in
   the episode, "Nature Pants,"^[414] and a particularly disheveled
   illustration of Squidward from "Squid's Day Off."^[415]

Merchandise

   characters

   The popularity of SpongeBob SquarePants inspired merchandise from
   T-shirts to posters.^[71] In 2009, it was reported that the franchise
   had generated an estimated $8 billion in merchandising revenue for
   Nickelodeon.^[416] The series is also the most distributed property of
   Paramount Media Networks.^[370] SpongeBob is viewed in 170 countries
   speaking 24 languages, and has become "a killer merchandising
   app".^[417] The title character and his friends have been used as a
   theme for special editions of well-known family board games, including
   Monopoly,^[418] Life,^[419] and Operation,^[420] as well as a SpongeBob

   In 2001, Nickelodeon signed a marketing deal with Target Corporation
   and Burger King, expanding its merchandising.^[158] The popularity of
   SpongeBob has translated well into sales. In 2002, SpongeBob
   SquarePants dolls sold at a rate of 75,000 per weekâ€”faster than Tickle
   Me Elmo dolls were selling at the time.^[423] SpongeBob has gained
   popularity in Japan, specifically with Japanese women. Nickelodeon's
   parent company Viacom purposefully targeted marketing at women there.
   Skeptics initially doubted that SpongeBob could be popular in Japan, as
   the character's design is very different from already popular designs
   for Hello Kitty and Pikachu.^[424] Ratings and merchandise sales showed
   SpongeBob SquarePants has caught on with parents and with college
   audiences.^[11] In a 2013 promotion, college-oriented website Music.com
   gave away 80,000 SpongeBob T-shirts, four times more than during a
   similar promotion for Comedy Central's South Park.^[11]

   Kids' meal tie-ins have been released in fast food restaurants in many
   parts of the world, including Burger King in Europe and North America,
   as well as Wendy's in North America, and Hungry Jack's in Australia. A
   McDonald's Happy Meal tie-in with SpongeBob-themed Happy Meal boxes and
   toys was released in Europe and other international markets in the
   summer of 2007.^[425] In Australia, the advertisement for the
   McDonald's SpongeBob Happy Meal won the Pester Power Award because the
   ads enticed young children to want its food because of the free
   toy.^[426] As a tie-in beverage for the DVD release of The SpongeBob
   SquarePants Movie, 7-Eleven released the limited edition Under-the-Sea
   Pineapple Slurpee in March 2004.^[427] Pirate's Booty released limited
   edition SpongeBob SquarePants Pirate's Booty snacks in
   2013.^[428]^[429]

   Imation Electronics Products under the Npower brand, including MP3
   players, digital cameras, a DVD player, and a flatscreen
   television.^[430] Pictures of SpongeBob SquarePants began to appear on
   the labels of 8 ounce cans of Green Giant cut green beans and packages
   of frozen Green Giant green beans and butter sauce in 2007, which
   featured free stickers. This was part of an initiative to encourage
   kids to eat their vegetables.^[431] The Simmons Jewelry Co. released a
   $75,000 diamond pendant as part of a SpongeBob collection.^[218]^[432]

   plush in a variety of clothing and accessories. Sandy Cheeks and Gary
   the Snail are also available as pre-stuffed minis.^[438] Build-A-Bear
   Workshop stores nationwide celebrated the arrival of SpongeBob with a
   series of special events from May 17 through May 19.^[439]

   On July 13, 2013, Toyota, with Nickelodeon, unveiled a
   SpongeBob-inspired Toyota Highlander.^[440] The 2014 Toyota Highlander
   was launched on SpongeBob Day at the San Diego Padres v. Giants
   game.^[441]^[442]^[443] The SpongeBob Toyota Highlander visited seven
   U.S. locations during its release, including the Nickelodeon Suites
   Resort Orlando in Florida.^[444]

   In April 2019, Nickelodeon released a series of toys adapted from
   various SpongeBob Internet memes. These included "Handsome Squidward",
   "Imaginaaation SpongeBob", "Mocking SpongeBob", "SpongeGar", and
   "Surprised Patrick". Shortly after the release of the line, most of the
   toys sold out on Amazon.com.^[445]^[446]
