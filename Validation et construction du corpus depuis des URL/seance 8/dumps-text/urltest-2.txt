   SpongeBob SquarePants is an American animated television series.
   Created by former marine biologist and animator Stephen Hillenburg, it
   is broadcasted on Nickelodeon, an American cable network. Since its
   debut on May 1, 1999, the series has aired over 250 episodes and is
   currently in its thirteenth season, which premiered on October 22,
   2020. The series follows the adventures of the title character and his
   various friends in the fictional underwater city of Bikini Bottom.

   The series' first feature film, The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie, was
   released in theaters in the United States on November 19, 2004. In
   season 5, the series' first television film, "Atlantis SquarePantis,"
   premiered on November 12, 2007 after a television marathon. In season
   6, the series' second television film, "Truth or Square," premiered on
   November 6, 2009. A second feature film, The SpongeBob Movie: Sponge
   Out of Water, was released in theaters in the United States on February
   6, 2015. In season 12, the series' third television film, "SpongeBob's
   Big Birthday Blowout," premiered on July 12, 2019. The series' third
   feature film, The SpongeBob Movie: Sponge on the Run, was released
   digitally on Paramount+ in the United States on March 4, 2021. The
   first eight seasons are available on DVD for Regions 1, 2 and 4 as of
   October 2017. Seasons 9, 10, 11, and 12 are available on DVD for Region
   1 as of January 12, 2021. The first spin-off series, Kamp Koral:
   SpongeBob's Under Years, premiered on Paramount+ on March 4, 2021. The
   second spin-off series, The Patrick Star Show, premiered on Nickelodeon
   on July 9, 2021.

   Hillenburg initially began to work on creating the show shortly after
   the cancellation of Rocko's Modern Life in 1996. To voice the character
   of SpongeBob, Hillenburg approached Tom Kenny, who had worked with him
   on Rocko's Modern Life as a voice actor. SpongeBob was originally to be
   named "SpongeBoy," but the name was already in use for a non-mop
   product. Upon finding it out, Hillenburg decided to use the name
   "SpongeBob." He chose "SquarePants" as a family name, as it referred to
   the character's square shape and it had a "nice ring to it."
