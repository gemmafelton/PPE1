Report finds three medical aid schemes ‘guilty’ of racial discrimination

   A damning interim report found that black practitioners were more
   likely to be found to have committed fraud than their non-black
   counterparts.

   An interim report, which was released on Tuesday, found three medical
   aid schemes guilty of racial discrimination towards black medical
   practitioners.

   In early 2019, a number of healthcare providers and members of
   Solutionist Thinkers and the National Health Care Professionals
   Association made allegations that they were being treated unfairly by
   medical aid schemes based on race and ethnicity. The Council for
   Medical Schemes (CMS) then launched an investigation into the
   allegations and released damning findings this week.

   Chairperson of the inquiry, Advocate Tembeka Ngcukaitobi and his panel,
   held public hearings last year commissioned by the CMS. The panel was
   mandated to investigate two main issues; whether there is racial
   discrimination by schemes against black health care providers and
   whether black providers were being treated procedurally unfairly.

   They have now released their report after a court dismissed an
   application by the GEMS medical scheme to block the release.

MEDICAL AID SCHEMES FOUND ‘GUILTY’ IN INTERIM REPORT

   After considering all the evidence and responses, they found that
   between 2012 and 2019 black practitioners were more likely to be found
   to have committed Fraud, Waste and Abuse (FWA) than their non-black
   (white) counterparts, by Discovery, Medscheme and GEMS.

     “This means, for the reasons provided in this interim Report, there
     was unfair racial discrimination,” the report stated.

   “Using the data that Discovery, GEMS and Medscheme provided the Panel
   and Dr Kimmie, there is a substantial difference in FWA outcomes
   between black and non-black practitioners over the period January 2012
   to June 2019,” it said.

     “Over this period, across all disciplines and the aforementioned
     three schemes and administrators, black practitioners were 1.4 times
     more likely to be classified as having committed FWA than those
     identified as not black,” it added.

   Black general practitioners are 1.5 times more likely to be identified
   as FWA cases than their non-black counterparts. The rate at which black
   physiotherapists are identified as FWA cases is almost double (1.87)
   that of their non-black counterparts. Black psychologists are three
   times more likely to be identified as FWA cases and black registered
   counsellors and social workers are also three times more likely to be
   identified as FWA cases.

     “More than 50% of black registered counsellors have been identified
     as FWA cases – this is the highest rate among the disciplines
     analysed, and black dieticians are 2.5 times more likely to be
     identified as FWA cases compared to their non-black counterparts,”
     it added.

   The report said there are clear differences in the scale of racial
   discrimination between the three medical aid schemes.

     “Discovery was 35% more likely to identify black providers as having
     committed FWA. GEMS was 80% more likely to identify black providers
     and Medscheme was 330% more likely to identify black providers as
     guilty of FW,” it said.

     “We have found that some of the current procedures followed by
     schemes to enforce their rights in terms of section 59 of the Act
     are unfair. We have also found that black providers are unfairly
     discriminated against on the grounds of race,” it added.

   The report summary can be found here.

MEDSCHEME DENIES RACIAL PROFILING

   Medical aid scheme — Medscheme — rejected the claims on Tuesday shortly
   after the interim report was released. It rejected claims that it
   performs any form of racial profiling when assessing or auditing
   healthcare claims.

     Executive Director at Medscheme Dr Lungi Nyathi said; “we are
     extremely disappointed that we were not afforded an opportunity to
     review the Interim Report of the Panel before it was published
     publicly, as had been agreed.”

     “We shall now review the contents of the Interim Report and make a
     formal submission in response thereto”.

   The statement went on to say that the company maintains confidence
   Medscheme’s forensic processes are fair, transparent and within the
   law.

   Discovery Health responded saying that it would study the interim
   findings and comment further within the six weeks set out for the
   schemes to do so.

     “We are committed to work constructively with the CMS to implement
     the recommendations of the Section 59 Investigation Panel, as part
     of a broader industry-level initiative to enhance tools and
     processes to efficiently and fairly manage Fraud, Waste and Billing
     Abuse,” it added.

   The South African also reached out to GEMS for further comment,
   however, there was no response at the time of publication.
