   Four days later, a [44]protest organized by MU students Alana Hayes and
   MarKeia "Nova" Kellogg was held in Speakers Circle to urge MU to
   formally condemn white supremacy and to take preventative measures
   against racial discrimination on campus.

   The MU administration did not issue any statements condemning white
   supremacy or the posters as demanded by protestors.
