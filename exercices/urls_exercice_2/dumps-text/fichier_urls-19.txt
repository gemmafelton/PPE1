   RACIAL SEGREGATION IN SOUTH AFRICA

   Racial segregation in South Africa was a major issue across the country
   which affected people’s lives especially for those who were non-white.
   This system was called as Apartheid which was a Afrikaan word standing
   for discrimination (HistoryExtra, 2015). In other words, Apartheid
   describes political and economic system of racial discrimination which
   was imposed by the white minority on non-white people (HistoryExtra,
   2015). In this article, how the apartheid system started and affected
   society politically, economically as well as socially will be
   explained.

OCCURRENCE OF APARTHEID SYSTEM

   The apartheid system was implemented by the governing party which was
   the National Party of South Africa (HistoryExtra, 2015). The system
   started in 1948 and lasted until 1994 (Kiddle, 2021). In the elections
   of 1948, the National Party got into power and in the following years
   new apartheid laws were made. The new laws enforced more strictly on
   non-white people (Kiddle, 2021). Under this system, the society in
   South Africa was divided according to their race and different races
   were forced to live separately from each other (Kiddle, 2021). Race
   discrimination was not a new phenomenon to South Africa, as racial
   legislation in the country could be seen back then in 1806
   (HistoryExtra, 2015). However, segregation was extended greatly with
   the Population Registration Act of 1950.(HistoryExtra,2015). According
   to this act, South African society would be divided into four
   categories: Bantu (black South Africans), Coloured (those of mixed
   race), White and Asian (Indian and Pakistani South Africans
   (HistoryExtra, 2015). The Act was designed to protect white supremacy
   in the country (HistoryExtra, 2015).

EFFECTS OF APARTHEID ON SOCIETY

   The effects of apartheid were felt in every aspect of the daily life of
   South African society, particularly on non-whites (HistoryExtra, 2015).
   They were overcome badly by political, economical and social conditions
   because of the system that was imposed. For instance, the social lives
   of non-whites affected in a way that they were not allowed to live in
   the areas which belonged to the white minority. This was because of
   several land acts which set aside more than 80 percent of the country
   land for the white minority. In addition to this, non-whites were
   supposed to carry documents in order to authorize their presence in
   restricted areas (History, 2010). Moreover, the government divided
   public facilities, ambulances, hospitals, buses into whites and
   non-whites in order to inhibit communication between races (History,
   2010). This establishment reached the target by limiting the activity
   of non-white labor unions, denying non-white participation in national
   government, and restricting the political rights of non-whites
   (History, 2010).


   In addition to land acts and denial of non-white participation in the
   national government, by 1950, marriage and sexual relations between
   white and non-white South Africans were strictly banned (HistoryExtra,
   2015). South Africans who disobeyed apartheid were sent to prison,
   fined, or whipped. Those who were suspected for being in a interracial
   relationship were hunted down under the Immorality Acts of 1927 and
   1950 (HistoryExtra, 2015). The effects on South Africa’s non-white
   population was horrendous (HistoryExtra, 2015). Families were forced to
   split because of the laws. For example, if parents were black and
   white, their children were called colored and due to this reason, 3.5
   million people were removed from their homes by governmental forces
   between 1961 and 1994 (HistoryExtra, 2015).


   Additionally, racial segregation affected the lives of the people who
   were non-whites economically. To exemplify, they were forced to live in
   black homelands where they were given permission to run businesses. If
   non-whites wanted to live and work in designated white areas, they had
   to obtain permission from the government (HistoryExtra, 2015).

DISOBEDIENCE OF APARTHEID LAWS AND DEFIANCE CAMPAIGN

   In 1952, the Defiance Campaign which was the first non- violent
   political campaign took place. It lasted about four months and 8,000
   volunteers rejected obeying the laws of apartheid by refusing to carry
   passes, violating curfews, and using public places and services
   designated for white use only (HistoryExtra, 2015). The Defiance
   Campaign, run by the African National Congress (ANC) as well as the
   South African Indian Congress, generated an immerse movement for
   freedom with South Africa itself (HistoryExtra, 2015). At the time,
   Nelson Mandela was president of the ANC Youth League (HistoryExtra,
   2015). He was a volunteer in chief of the 1952 Defiance Campaign. He
   went on to play a leading role in generating large-scale resistance to
   apartheid (HistoryExtra, 2015). However, Mandela’s involvement in both
   peaceful and armed resistance caused him to be sentenced to 27 years in
   1962 which he was exposed to inhumane conditions in prison
   (HistoryExtra, 2015).

   Besides this, the Defiance Campaign and resistance to apartheid
   attracted the attention of the United Nations (HistoryExtra, 2015). In
   1973, the UN denounced apartheid, but the situation escalated in 1976
   when police opened fire with tear gas and bullets on children in Soweto
   (HistoryExtra, 2015). The violence caused an outrage and the UN imposed
   an embargo on the sale of arms to South Africa in 1985 followed by
   economic sanctions from the UK and US (HistoryExtra, 2015).

PRESIDENCY OF NELSON MANDELA AND ABOLISHMENT OF APARTHEID LAWS

   The last president came in the office during the apartheid era was
   Frederik Willem de Klerk (Kiddle, 2021). In 1990, President Frederik de
   Klerk began negotiations with Mandela to end apartheid (History, 2010).
   In the same year, the world also saw Nelson Mandela get out of prison
   where he continued to conduct the campaign (HistoryExtra, 2015). The
   negotiations between Frederik de Klerk and Nelson Mandela were so
   successful and Nelson Mandela was elected to the presidency of South
   Africa after multi-racial elections took place in April, 1994 (Kiddle,
   2021). Eventually, he became the first black person to be president in
   South Africa, and the apartheid system as well as its laws were
   abolished in 1994 (Kiddle, 2021).



   In conclusion, racial segregation was a system in South Africa that
   affected the lives of people who were non-whites. Additionally, black
   people in South Africa were deprived of human rights politically,
   socially, and economically which they could not be the same as the
   white minority living in South Africa. Thanks to Nelson Mandela and
   Frederik Willem de Klerk, this system that imposed white supremacy came
   to an end. Nelson became a figure of equality and when he died, he
   became one of the greatest men ever to live on planet earth (History,
   2010). Today, there are a lot of monuments left in the memory of Nelson
   (History, 2010).
