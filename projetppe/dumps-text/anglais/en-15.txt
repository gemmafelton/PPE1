   Racial and ethnic discrimination has a significant impact on the health
   of people of color, affecting mental health and contributing to high
   blood pressure, negative health behaviors, and early aging.^[44]1 For
   Black older adults, the cumulative effects of race-related stress
   experienced over the course of a life can increase the risk for mental
   and physical health problems.^[45]2

   In health care settings, experiences of discrimination can include
   providers dismissing a patient's symptoms or health concerns, offering
   different treatment based on a patient's type of insurance,^[46]3 or
   not providing care in a patient's preferred language.^[47]4

   We analyzed findings from the Commonwealth Fund 2021 International
   Health Policy Survey of Older Adults to examine experiences of racial
   discrimination in health care settings among Latinx/Hispanic and Black
   older adults. (See "[48]How We Conducted This Study" for more details.)
   To provide some cross-national context, we first detail the extent to
   which older adults in 11 high-income countries believe their national
   health system treats people unfairly because of race or ethnicity. We
   then look more in-depth at the United States and report on older
   Americans' experiences of discrimination and the consequences of health
   providers' unfair or dismissive treatment.^[49]5 Finally, we consider
   steps that U.S. health system leaders, health care educators,
   policymakers, and others can take to address discrimination and
   dismantle systemic racism in health care.

Highlights

     * Older adults in the United States are more likely to report racial
       and ethnic discrimination in the health system exists, compared
       with their peers in 10 other high-income countries.
     * In the U.S., one in four Black and Latinx/Hispanic adults age 60
       and older reported that they have been treated unfairly or have
       felt that their health concerns were not taken seriously by health
       professionals because of their racial or ethnic background.
     * More than a quarter of U.S. older adults said they did not get the
       care or treatment they felt they needed because of discrimination.
     * U.S. older adults who have experienced discrimination in a health
       care setting were more likely to have worse health status, face
       economic hardships, and be more dissatisfied with their care than
       those who did not experience discrimination.


Findings

   Doty_racial_ethnic_discrimination_older_adults_Exhibit_01

   Looking across 11 high-income countries, one in three older adults in
   the U.S. said they believe their health system treats people
   differently because of their race or ethnicity, nearly double the rate
   of older adults in Canada (17%).

   Doty_racial_ethnic_discrimination_older_adults_Exhibit_02

   In the United States, Black women and men are the most likely of any
   group to believe the health care system very often or often treats
   people differently because of their race or ethnicity. Across racial
   and ethnic groups, more women than men hold this view.

   Doty_racial_ethnic_discrimination_older_adults_Exhibit_03

   When asked whether they have ever been treated unfairly or felt that
   their health concerns were not taken seriously because of their racial
   or ethnic background, one in four Black and Latinx/Hispanic older
   adults in the U.S. said they have experienced this type of
   discrimination, approximately eight times the rate for older white
   adults. There were not significant differences by gender between racial
   or ethnic groups.^[50]6

   Doty_racial_ethnic_discrimination_older_adults_Exhibit_04

   More than a quarter (27%) of all U.S. older adults who experienced
   race- or ethnicity-based discrimination -- either their provider
   treated them unfairly or dismissed their health concerns because of
   their race or ethnicity -- said they did not receive the care they felt
   they needed.^[51]7 Previous research on older adults of color found
   that perceived discrimination was associated with an increased risk of
   avoiding or delaying care, in part because doctors may communicate
   messages that discourage appropriate use of health services.^[52]8

   Doty_racial_ethnic_discrimination_older_adults_Exhibit_05

   The majority (61%) of U.S. older adults who said that they experienced
   discrimination based on their race or ethnicity were Black or Latinx
   (data not shown). Nearly half of those who experienced such
   discrimination reported being in fair or poor health, twice the rate of
   those who did not experience discrimination. In fact, three-quarters of
   adults who have felt discriminated against have three or more chronic
   conditions or need help with daily activities (data not shown). Older
   adults who have faced discrimination based on their race or ethnicity
   are also significantly more likely to feel socially isolated, have a
   mental health diagnosis, and experience a material hardship (always or
   usually feeling stressed about having enough money to pay for food,
   housing, or monthly bills).

   Older adults who have felt discriminated against when receiving care
   are significantly more likely to be dissatisfied with the quality of
   their care than those not reporting discrimination.^[53]9 More than
   four in 10 respondents who reported discrimination said they are
   somewhat or not at all satisfied, about double the rate for those who
   did not report discrimination.

   Consistent with previous research, older Black and Latinx/Hispanic
   adults are more likely than older white adults to report being in fair
   or poor health and to experience material hardships (data not shown).

Policy Recommendations

   Battling discrimination throughout the health care system is imperative
   to advancing health equity. Given that older adults use far more health
   care services than do younger people, and that the U.S. population is
   rapidly aging, addressing discrimination in health care settings is
   especially important for older adults of color. Ending discrimination
   and racism in health care begins with recognizing it and then actively
   working to dismantle it. Following are recommendations for spurring and
   supporting such efforts.

   Promote transparency and accountability by identifying instances of
   discrimination and publicly reporting discrimination data. One way is
   to provide patients with the opportunity to report experiences of
   racism or other types of discrimination when completing standard
   patient satisfaction surveys. Health care organizations could expand
   existing patient experience surveys to ask about discrimination, bring
   these reports to the attention of system leaders, and identify
   opportunities for improvement. To promote accountability, health care
   organizations also could be required to publicly report responses.

   Older adults of color, particularly those with health concerns, have
   many interactions with health personnel. Allowing them opportunities to
   reflect on how they were treated and to report their experiences with
   discrimination are important steps.

   Develop medical school curricula to educate students about how the U.S.
   health care system has harmed patients of color and other historically
   marginalized communities. Studies have shown that medical students'
   perceptions of race and implicit biases, together with false ideas of
   race-based biological differences, can affect their treatment
   recommendations for patients of color.^[54]10 The same is true for
   older patients: when medical students are exposed only to the sickest
   older patients in their training, they may adopt stereotypical thinking
   that affects treatment.^[55]11 To encourage their students to address
   bias, medical schools could teach the history of racism in the health
   system, institute implicit-bias training, and ensure that race is
   understood as a risk marker, not necessarily a risk factor, for health
   outcomes.^[56]12

   Examine how current policies enable discrimination and then remove or
   reform those policies. Understanding how federal, state, and health
   care organizations' policies and care delivery approaches enable
   discrimination and racism is an important step in diagnosing and
   treating racism in the health system at large.^[57]13 The National
   Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine is currently reviewing
   federal policies that promote health disparities, but private
   institutions could also systematically review their policies and
   practices to determine if and how they harm persons of color.^[58]14

   Address the lack of diversity in the U.S. health care workforce. A
   diverse health care workforce can help promote the cultural competency
   of providers and improve access to health care, since providers of
   color are more likely to work in underserved communities, including
   those with large elderly populations.^[59]15 Providers whose racial or
   ethnic background reflects that of their patients can also engender
   greater trust. To foster diversity, medical schools could show how they
   are seeking to improve diversity among faculty and students, evaluate
   the diversity and experiences of those on recruitment committees, and
   target community colleges, historically Black colleges and
   universities, and Hispanic-serving institutions in their
   recruitment.^[60]16

   Provide culturally and contextually appropriate care that addresses
   patients' communication needs and preferences. All patients should have
   the opportunity to receive care the reflects their cultural values and
   language needs. To provide such care, organizations can offer
   translation services and create medical forms in multiple languages and
   provide cultural competency training to staff.^[61]17 Organizations
   also could work with the communities they serve to ensure care delivery
   reflects the needs and preferences of the community.

   By taking these steps, health care organizations can do their part to
   address discrimination against older and younger adults alike to
   improve health equity and outcomes.

   HOW WE CONDUCTED THIS STUDY

   The Commonwealth Fund 2021 International Health Policy Survey of Older
   Adults was conducted from March 1 to June 14, 2021, by SSRS, a U.S.
   survey research firm, and contractors in the other countries. The
   survey was administered to a nationally representative sample of adults
   age 60 and older in the United States from March 11 to May 27, 2021.
   The survey was also administered to adults age 65 and older in
   Australia, Canada, France, Germany, the Netherlands, New Zealand,
   Norway, Sweden, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom.

   The final U.S. sample was 1,969. Interviews were completed either
   online or using computer-assisted telephone interviews. Samples were
   generated using probability-based overlapping landline and mobile phone
   sampling designs. Both mobile and landline telephone numbers were
   included to improve representativeness. For landline samples, standard
   within-household selection procedures were used to increase the
   likelihood of reaching an eligible respondent.

   A common questionnaire was developed, translated, adapted, and adjusted
   for country-specific wording as needed. Interviewers were trained to
   conduct interviews using a standardized protocol. The U.S. response
   rate was 11.2 percent.

   International partners joined with the Commonwealth Fund to sponsor
   surveys, and some countries supported the use of expanded samples to
   enable within-country analyses. Data were weighted to ensure that the
   final outcome was representative of the adult population in each
   country. Weighting procedures considered the sample design, probability
   of selection, and systematic nonresponse across known population
   parameters including region, sex, age, education, and other demographic
   characteristics deemed consistent with standards for each country. In
   the United States, the weighted variables also included race and
   ethnicity.

   The margin of sample error for the 2021 International Health Policy
   Survey of Older Adults was approximately +/- 2 percent for the U.S., at
   the 95 percent confidence interval.

    5. Questions related to experiencing unfair or dismissive treatment
       and the consequences of discrimination were asked in the U.S. only.
       The U.S. sample included adults age 60 and older; respondents who
       self-identified as Asian American or another racial or ethnic group
       were not included in this study because of limited sample sizes.
    6. Black and Latinx/Hispanic adults make up most older adults (61%) in
       the U.S. who reported discrimination, yet these adults comprise
       only 19 percent of the survey population. Sample size of
       respondents who reported discrimination (N=149) is too small to
       stratify the analysis by race and ethnicity.
    7. Sample sizes for this item were too small to stratify by race and
       ethnicity.
