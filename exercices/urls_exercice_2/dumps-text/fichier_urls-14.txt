   Statement by Katherine Bundra, IFRC Research Associate, at the United
   Nations Human Rights Council, in Geneva.

   The International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies
   welcomes this discussion on racism and the active preparation of the
   Durban Review Conference, which is of vital importance to us.

   Since its inception, the International Federation of Red Cross and Red
   Crescent Societies (IFRC) has actively challenged racism and racial
   discrimination.

   The Fundamental Principles of our Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement
   explicitly prohibit any form of discrimination and racism.

   Decades ago, our Governing Board requested all Red Cross/Red Crescent
   Societies to combat racism in all its forms highlighting that racism
   and racial discrimination are a violation of human dignity and human
   rights.

   In addition, they are serious impediments to the strengthening of
   community resilience in the face of disasters and public health
   threats, and to the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals.

   Our commitment to protecting human dignity and tackling discrimination
   was given a further practical dimension in November 2007 at the 30th
   International Conference of the Red Cross and Red Crescent.

   At that Conference, all 194 States Parties to the Geneva Conventions,
   all our 186 RC/RC National Societies, as well as the IFRC and ICRC
   adopted the Declaration 'Together for Humanity' which addressed the
   main humanitarian challenges now facing the world.

   Within the context of addressing violence, in particular in urban
   settings, all conference members formally committed themselves to
   'intensify efforts to mobilise community respect for diversity and
   action against racism, discrimination, xenophobia, marginalization and
   other forms of exclusion, faced by all vulnerable groups, ... based on
   the considerable experience of National Societies'.

   This commitment is an active reflection of the way we manage all our
   programs, in all parts of the world.

   Despite all that has been done, and all the laws enacted by
   governments, discrimination unfortunately remains an endemic problem
   today. It is with deep regret that we have seen a growth of
   anti-foreigner xenophobia and violence in a variety of countries.

   It is particularly troublesome to have witnessed the urban violence
   which has affected South Africa, a country which has built a proud and
   justified record of tolerance, a "Rainbow Nation" which has celebrated
   the benefits of inclusion embracing many cultures and languages.

   Nevertheless, the South African Red Cross Society stands as an example
   of a National Society whose preparedness and volunteer strength has
   enabled it to be an effective provider of emergency relief, mobilising
   its network of hundreds of volunteers and staff, from 35 local branches
   throughout the country.

   After the violence began on 12 May 2008 it launched a national
   emergency appeal, and has been gratified by the generous response it
   has received from the South African public.

   This has been followed by a number of National Society measures,
   culminating in a proactive awareness-raising campaign and an
   anti-discrimination campaign drawing from the International Conference
   outcome, under the banner Together for Humanity.

   South Africa also provides an example of the way the IFRC is able to
   support a National Society in such times.

   We released funds from our Disaster Response Emergency Fund to enable a
   team of technical experts to assist the Society in the distribution of
   emergency relief items as well as providing tracing services, first aid
   and basic counselling to those affected by the violence.

   Together with the South African Red Cross Society, we have also
   integrated an anti-discrimination perspective in its operational
   response, for instance by including leaders of displaced communities in
   the decision-making processes when providing relief assistance.

   This is a dramatic example of the Red Cross Red Crescent at work, but
   all our National Societies are committed to working towards the same
   objectives.

   In the post-election violence, the Kenya Red Cross demonstrated how it
   was able to effectively reach all different ethnic groups and played a
   bridging role uniting the nation.

   The auxiliary role of the Red Cross Red Crescent Societies to their
   public authorities in the humanitarian field, offers them a privileged
   platform to engage in humanitarian advocacy and influence
   decision-making.

   The Spanish Red Cross Society, for example, operates a project titled,
   'Building spaces for social inclusion' focusing on immigrants by
   emphasising social sensitization and reducing stereotypes.

   It lobbies with government bodies to foster equal opportunities,
   present a positive image of immigration and diversity, and address
   discrimination.

   At the same time, we recognise that we need to do more. We see now many
   Red Cross Red Crescent Societies supporting youth camps, which bring
   together volunteers from different cultures and religions, to foster
   understanding and explore ways of working together.

   We strongly believe in the role of youth as agents for behavioural
   change. As requested by the last International Conference, we are
   working on empowering youth to prevent, defuse or mitigate violence,
   particularly in urban settings, tackle discrimination and foster social
   cohesion, through developing training in skills such as non-judgment
   and consensus building.

   Let me conclude, Mr. President, by reiterating the need to reinforce
   the foundation of our common existence as members of a universal human
   family with inherent dignity, and equal and inalienable rights.

   Each one of us should seek to stop divisive labelling which feeds the
   seeds of violence and leads to a racial, civilizational and religious
   partitioning of the world.

   We need to view diversity as a source of wealth rather than a threat,
   and see beyond our common humanity, the aspirations and vulnerability
   which all humans profoundly share in the deepest of their being.

   We look forward to taking these points further in our discussions with
   members of the Human Rights Council and the Office of the High
   Commissioner.

   We will in particular be examining the best ways of employing the
   energy of our National Societies and their grass roots network of tens
   of millions of trained volunteers in the promotion of effective
   humanitarian dialogue which makes a real contribution to addressing the
   causes of racism and discrimination.

   Laws have been made, virtually everywhere, but more needs to be done.

   We call upon governments to support capacity-building at the grass root
   level and campaigns designed in consultation with the communities
   themselves.

   We will be emphasising this point at the Durban Review Conference, and
   look forward to your support as we develop and intensify our own
   programs in this area.
