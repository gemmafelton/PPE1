   A question that seems to be asked with increasing frequency is whether
   Asian Americans are the beneficiaries of privileges historically
   afforded to white people in the United States or if we are the victims
   of racial discrimination. But reality is much more complex. It's time
   to discard this simplistic dichotomy.

   Take the [124]Students for Fair Admissions v[125]. Harvard case to be
   heard in the US Supreme Court in October. Plaintiffs in the case argue
   that Asian Americans experience racial discrimination in Harvard
   admissions, as evidenced, they claim, by admitted Asian American
   students' higher GPAs and SAT scores compared to admitted students of
   all other races, including white students. They also point to
--
   achievement means the end of anti-Asian racism or that Asian Americans
   sometimes benefiting from privileges previously reserved for white
   Americans means we always benefit from the privileges of whiteness. The
   multifaceted nature of racial discrimination and privilege in the
   United States is far more complex. To tackle it, we need to understand
   its diverse faces.
