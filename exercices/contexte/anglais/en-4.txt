   The US Justice Department on Wednesday filed what it is describing as a
   first-of-its-kind settlement in a racial discrimination case
   challenging a so-called "crime-free housing ordinance."

   The [132]proposed consent decree was filed Wednesday in a lawsuit the
   Justice Department [133]brought in 2019 against the central California
   city of Hesperia, alleging that the city's ordinance violated the Fair
   Housing Act's prohibitions on racial discrimination in housing access.

   Hesperia continues to deny the allegations.
