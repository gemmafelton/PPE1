Why Does Racial Inequality Persist?Culture, Causation, and Responsibility

Racial Inequality: A Conceptual Framework

   Over the last 40 years, I've explored why, notwithstanding the success
   of the civil rights movement, the subordinate status of
   African-Americans persists. Key to my thinking about this intractable
   problem has been the need to distinguish the role played by
   discrimination against black people from that played by
   counterproductive behavioral patterns among blacks.

   This puts what is a very sensitive issue rather starkly. Many vocal
   advocates for racial equality have been loath to consider the
   possibility that problematic patterns of behavior could be an important
   factor contributing to our persisting disadvantaged status. Some
   observers on the right of American politics, meanwhile, take the
   position that discrimination against blacks is no longer an important
   determinant of unequal social outcomes. I have long tried to chart a
   middle course--acknowledging antiblack biases that should be remedied
   while insisting on addressing and reversing the patterns of behavior
   that impede black people from seizing newly opened opportunities to
   prosper. I still see this as the most sensible position.

   These two positions can be recast as causal narratives. One is what I
   call the "bias narrative": racism and white supremacy have done us
   wrong; we can't get ahead until they relent; so we must continue urging
   the reform of white American society toward that end.

   The other is what I call the "development narrative," according to
   which it is essential to consider how a person comes to acquire those
   skills, traits, habits, and orientations that foster successful
   participation in American society. To the extent that African-American
   youngsters do not have the experiences, are not exposed to the
   influences, and do not benefit from the resources that foster and
   facilitate their human development, they fail to achieve their full
   human potential. This lack of development is what ultimately causes the
   persistent, stark racial disparities in income, wealth, education,
   family structure, and much else. (The charts and tables on this and the
   next several pages offer a glimpse of the magnitude of these
   disparities.)

   In terms of prescribing intervention and remedy, these causal
   narratives point in very different directions. The bias narrative says
   that we need to have a "conversation" about race: white America must
   reform itself; racism must end; we need more of this or that, whatever
   the "this" or "that" is on the agenda of today's race reformers. One
   hears this kind of talk, one reads these exhortations, in newspapers
   and other media every day.

   The development narrative puts more onus on the responsibilities of
   African-Americans to develop our human potential. It is not satisfied
   with wishful thinking like: "If we could only double the budget for
   some social program, the homicide rate among young African-American men
   would be less atrocious." Or, "If we can just get this police
   department investigated by the Department of Justice, then...." The
   development narrative asks, Then what? Then it will be safe to walk on
   the south side of Chicago after midnight?

   Meanwhile, the terms themselves--race and discrimination--are often
   bandied about without being rigorously defined. In a 2002 book, The
   Anatomy of Racial Inequality, I sketched a theory of race applicable to
   the social and historical circumstances of the U.S., speculated about
   why racial inequalities persist, and advanced a conceptual framework
   for thinking about social justice in matters of race.[[150]1] Because
   there remains so much confusion in today's public discussions about
   race and racial inequality, I need to revisit that framework. Bear with
   me. The relevance of this conceptual excursion will be clear soon
   enough.

Categorization Versus Signification

   For me, the term "race" refers to indelible and heritable marks on
   human bodies--skin color, hair texture, bone structure--that are of no
   intrinsic significance but that nevertheless have, through time, come
   to be invested with social expectations that are more or less
   reasonable and social meanings that are more or less durable. When we
   talk about race in America or anywhere else, we are actually dealing
   with two distinct processes: categorization and signification.
   Categorization entails sorting people into a small number of subsets
   based on bodily marks and differentiating one's dealings with such
   persons accordingly. It is a cognitive act--an effort to comprehend the
   social world around us.

   Signification is an interpretative act--one that associates certain
   connotations or "social meanings" with those categories. Informational
   and symbolic issues are both at play. Or, as I like to put it, when we
   speak about race, we are really talking about "embodied social
   signification."[[151]2]

   It is instructive to contrast a social-cognitive conception of race
   with acts of biological taxonomy--sorting humans based on presumed
   variations of genetic endowments across what had for eons been
   geographically isolated subpopulations. Such isolation was, until
   recently, the human condition, and it may be thought to have led to the
   emergence of distinct races. Nevertheless, using the term "race" in
   this way is controversial, particularly if the aim is to explain social
   inequalities between groups.

   Thus, scientists, such as the population geneticist Luigi
   Cavalli-Sforza,[[152]3] and social critics, such as the philosopher
   Anthony Appiah,[[153]4] deny that "race" refers to anything real. What
   they have in mind is the biological-taxonomic notion, and what they
   deny is that meaningful distinctions among human subgroups pertinent to
   accounting for racial inequality can be derived from this notion. I am
   not arguing this point--though it would appear to be eminently
   arguable. What I am emphasizing is that to establish the scientific
   invalidity of race demonstrates neither the irrationality nor the
   immorality of invoking racial classification as acts of social
   cognition. So I shall employ the concept of race here, with an emphasis
   on the negative interpretative/symbolic connotations attached to
   "blackness" in the U.S.[[154]5]

Reward Bias Versus Development Bias

   Given this theoretical understanding of race, what might one say about
   the causes of persistent racial inequality? Fundamental is the
   elemental distinction I first drew in 2002 between racial
   discrimination and racial stigma. Discrimination is about how blacks
   are treated; stigma is about how blacks are perceived.

   What I call "reward bias" (conventional racial discrimination) is now a
   less significant barrier to the full participation of African-Americans
   in U.S. society than what I call "development bias." Reward bias
   focuses on the disadvantageous treatment of black people in formal
   transactions that limits their rewards for skills and talents presented
   to the market. Development bias refers to impediments that block access
   for black people to those resources necessary to develop and refine
   their talents but that are conveyed via informal social relations. This
   is where the consideration of culture enters the picture.

   Reward bias is grounded in racially discriminatory transactions, but
   development bias is ultimately rooted in racially stigmatized social
   relations. Many resources that foster human development only become
   available to persons as the by-product of informal, race-influenced
   social interactions. Another way to put this expanded view of
   discrimination: reward bias reflects discrimination in contract while
   development bias reflects discrimination in contact.

   Obviously, these two forms of bias are not mutually exclusive. The
   acquisition of skills can be blocked by overt discriminatory treatment,
   and a regime of market discrimination under pressure from the forces of
   economic competition may require informal instruments of social control
   to maintain that discriminatory regime.[[155]6] Though both kinds of
   bias promote racial inequality, the distinction is useful.

   The moral problem presented by reward bias is straightforward and calls
   for an uncontroversial remedy: laws against overt racial
   discrimination. Development bias presents a subtler and more insidious
   ethical challenge that may be difficult to remedy via public policies
   in any way that garners majoritarian support. Ultimately, development
   bias deals with some cultural patterns that are characteristic of both
   a racial minority group and the society at large, while reward bias
   deals with overt antiblack discriminatory treatment that, even though
   it has not been fully eliminated, is nevertheless nearly universally
   condemned.

   The difficulties for remedying development bias have a cognitive and an
   ethical dimension. In terms of cognition, when confronted with a racial
   group's poor social performance, an observer may be unable to
   distinguish between blocked developmental opportunities and limited
   capacities or distorted values. In ethical terms, citizens who find the
   "transactional discrimination" associated with reward bias to be
   noxious may be less offended by the covert, subconscious "relational
   discrimination" that underlies development bias.[[156]7]

   Regarding the distinction between reward bias and development bias: to
   understand persistent racial inequality in America, it is crucial to
   put relations before transactions. The focus on discriminatory economic
   transactions may not be sufficient; one will need also to consider the
   consequences of racially stigmatized social relations. Stigma--the
   distorted social meanings attaching to "blackness"--inhibits the access
   that some black people have to those networks of social affiliation
   where developmental resources are most readily appropriated. This might
   happen because black people are socially excluded; it might also happen
   because we choose to be socially withdrawn.

   On this view, persistent inequality may no longer be due mainly to a
   racially discriminatory marketplace, or an administrative state that
   refuses to reward black talent equally, as was the case in decades
   past. Rather, today's problem may be due, in large part, to a
   race-tinged psychology of perception and valuation--a way of seeing
   black people, and a way of black people seeing themselves, that impedes
   the acquisition of traits that are valued in the marketplace and are
   essential for human development.

   This can lead to a vicious circle. The status of a racial group as
   stigmatized in the social imagination--and crucially, in its own
   self-understanding--can be rationalized and socially reproduced because
   of that group's subordinate position in the economic order. Moreover,
   this way of thinking implies that the explanatory categories of "racial
   discrimination" and "racially distinct behaviors" are not mutually
   exclusive.

Social Capital Versus Human Capital

   A quarter-century before the publication of The Anatomy of Racial
   Inequality, I coined the term "social capital" to help account for
   persistent racial inequality in the U.S.[[157]8] The concept behind
   social capital illuminates the difference between informal social
   relations and formal economic transactions--between reward and
   development bias--as mechanisms perpetuating the subordinate position
   of African-Americans.

   As an economist, I sought to differentiate social capital with the more
   familiar term in my own field: "human capital." Human-capital theory
   attempts to account for variation in people's earnings capacities by
   analogy with well-developed theories of investment. These theories
   begin with the assumption of competitive markets and rational choice by
   forward-looking individuals, and then analyze investment decisions in
   light of individuals' time preferences, their anticipated rates of
   return, and the available alternatives for uses of their time.
   Human-capital theory imports into the study of human inequality an
   intellectual framework that had been well developed in economics to
   explain the investment decisions of firms--a framework that focuses on
   the analysis of formal economic transactions.

   I argued that associating business with human investments is merely an
   analogy, not an identity--particularly if one seeks to explain
   persistent racial disparities. Human capital, as an economic concept,
   overlooks two important facts having to do with informal social
   relations.

   First, all human development is socially situated and mediated. Human
   development takes place between people, by way of human interactions,
   within social institutions--the family, the community, the school, the
   peer group. Many resources essential to human development, such as the
   attention that parents give to their children, are not alienable. These
   resources, for the most part, are not commodities and are not up for
   sale. Instead, structured connections between individuals create the
   context within which developmental resources come to be allocated to
   individual persons. Opportunity travels along the synapses of these
   social networks.

   The resulting allocation of developmental resources need not be
   responsive to prices or be economically efficient. The development of
   human beings is not the same as corporate investment, and it is not a
   good metaphor, or a good analogy, to reason as though this were so.

   Human development begins before birth. The decisions a mother
   makes--about how closely to attend to her health and nutrition during
   pregnancy, for instance--will alter the neurological development of her
   fetus. This, and a myriad of other decisions and actions, all come
   together to shape the experience of the infant, who will mature one day
   to become a human being, and about whom it will be said that he or she
   has this or that much productivity, as reflected in his or her wages or
   academic test scores.

   This productivity, the behavioral and cognitive capacities bearing on a
   person's social and economic functioning, are not merely the result of
   a mechanical infusion of material resources. Rather, these are
   by-products of social processes mediated by networks of human
   affiliation, and these processes are fundamentally important for
   understanding persistent racial disparities.

   Second, what we call "race" is mainly a social, and only indirectly a
   biological, phenomenon. The persistence across generations of racial
   differentiation between large groups of people, in an open society
   where individuals live in proximity to one another, provides
   irrefutable indirect evidence of a profound separation between the
   racially defined networks of social affiliation within that society.
   There would be no races in the steady state of any dynamic social
   system unless, on a daily basis and with regard to their most intimate
   affairs, people paid assiduous attention to the boundaries separating
   themselves from racially distinct others. Over time, race would cease
   to exist unless people chose to act in a manner so as biologically to
   reproduce the variety of phenotypic expression that constitutes the
   substance of racial distinction.

   If the goal is to understand durable racial inequality in a society,
   one needs to attend in detail to the processes that cause race to
   persist as a fact of life, because such processes will be related to
   the allocation of human developmental resources in that society.

   Race, as a feature of a society, rests upon the cultural conceptions
   about identity held by the people--in America, principally blacks and
   whites alike--in that society. These are the beliefs that people hold
   about who they are and about the legitimacy of conducting intimate
   relations (and not only sexual relations) with racially distinct
   others. Beliefs of this kind affect the access that people enjoy to
   those informal resources that individuals require to develop their
   human potential. Social capital is a critical prerequisite for creating
   what economists refer to as human capital.

   Any conceptual framework for the study of persistent racial inequality
   is incomplete if it fails to consider the interactions between those
   social processes ensuring the reproduction of racial difference, on one
   hand, and those processes facilitating human development, on the other
   hand. If we consider these interactions, it becomes easier to see the
   many intimate connections between the antiblack "racial bias" that
   liberals emphasize and the "behavioral pathology" of (some) blacks that
   (some) conservatives are so keen to focus on.

Nobody Is Coming to Save Us

   I know how difficult it can be to see those connections--it has taken
   me many years to recognize them. My doctoral dissertation included an
   essay that was very close to the liberal, "racial bias" narrative.
   History, I wrote, casts a long shadow. Contemporary racial inequality
   in America reflects a history of deprivation, discrimination, and
   dispossession of black people. We can't expect this problem to cure
   itself. Thus, social justice rightly understood would involve some kind
   of reparation. I didn't use that word, but I did advocate for some
   intervention by the state on behalf of the explicit goal of racial
   equality. Otherwise, I reasoned, we would be stuck indefinitely with
   the consequences of an unjust past.[[158]9]

   That was Glenn Loury circa 1976. By 1985, I had become a Reagan
   Republican, emphasizing the problems of single-parent families,
   out-of-wedlock births among blacks, low labor-force participation and
   educational performance, and high criminal and victimization rates. My
   favored formulation: there is an enemy without--namely, racism; but
   there is also an enemy within--namely, behavior patterns inhibiting
   African-Americans from seizing such opportunities as had come to exist.
   I stressed to other blacks that if we were ever to achieve equality
   within American society, we could not simply rely on the
   antidiscrimination laws and affirmative action; we would also have to
   address some of these internal behavioral patterns. I still believe
   this to be the case.

   By pointing to the "enemy within," I did not deny that the ultimate
   source of such adverse internal patterns might be historical
   discrimination. (Although as a social scientist, I recognized that this
   kind of causal inference question is nearly impossible to resolve
   convincingly by looking at data.) But it did not matter so much what
   the ultimate sources of internal behavioral patterns were; what
   mattered was how they were to be reversed.

   The majority of African-American children are born to a woman without a
   husband. It is extremely implausible to imagine how this would be
   reversed by government policies such as the redistribution of
   resources. (I am aware of no evidence to this effect.) If this trend is
   to be reversed at all, it would require a determined effort by
   African-Americans to think differently about our responsibilities to
   our children and to one another.

   And so I would say to fellow African-Americans: No one is coming to
   save us! The situation in which we find ourselves is unfair, but this
   is not a question of justice. Nobody is coming, and, more
   fundamentally, no one can come into the most intimate relations between
   our women and men, into the families and neighborhoods where our
   children are being raised, so as to reorder those cultural institutions
   in a manner that would be more developmentally constructive.

   These matters are ultimately and necessarily in the hands of
   African-Americans alone. They require facing up to such questions as:
   Who are we as a people? How should we live with one another? What will
   we do to honor the sacrifices that our ancestors made to leave us the
   opportunities we now enjoy? What do we owe our children?

   Think about black-on-black crime. Unemployment rates, wealth holdings,
   residential segregation, and biased policing all may be playing some
   role in this problem. But young black men are killing one another at
   extraordinary rates. Notwithstanding the potential beneficial effects
   of various social policies, no one is coming to save black people from
   that pathology. If we are not prepared to condemn this contemptible
   behavior and to cooperate with institutions of civil authority that are
   legitimately addressing it--if we are unable to recognize that this is
   a tragic failure with the way that black people are living--we will
   likely be facing exactly the same issues for many years to come.

"Bias Narratives" Can Take on (Viral) Lives of Their Own

   Today, as social-justice warriors take to the streets to protest
   against racism, it is important to recognize the role played by
   Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and other social media. Many people get
   news from online sources that play to the narrative that American
   society is overwhelmingly populated by white bigots; so incidents that
   are not at all representative nevertheless become iconic because they
   go viral. A student finds something resembling a noose near his
   dorm-room door; a security guard says to someone, "I am unsure whether
   you belong here. Let me see your ID"; customers are asked to leave a
   food-service establishment when the manager thinks that their behavior
   is inconsistent with the establishment's rules. These incidents become
   national events. It is not simply that something has happened, or that
   a lot of people know about something having happened. Rather, what
   matters is that a lot of people know that many people know of the
   incidents in question.

   Idiosyncratic occurrences then become "driving while black,"
   "barbecuing while black," "swimming while black," "shopping while
   black," "walking while black," and so forth. The narrative of pervasive
   antiblack racism becomes a trope. When millions of people focus on the
   same events and reinforce one another in their comments, declaring
   one's outrage at such incidents becomes a substitute for reasoning
   about what larger meaning, if any, should be attached to these events.

   I often ask people who tell me about these incidents: Why do we care?
   Why should I care whether a woman was asked to put out her cigarette
   when a police officer stopped her for a broken taillight on a dusty
   road in Texas? Is that supposed to be emblematic of the treatment of
   black people in this country?

   As a social scientist, I am loath to operate based on a few anecdotes.
   For many who embrace the bias narrative, however, that's what is
   happening. Incidents that are not representative but that are salient
   within a bias narrative go viral and shape the consciousness of many.
   The viral social construction of episodes that are not the substance of
   our lives comes to shape our politics via exaggerated projections onto
   the surface of our lives. This is not "politics"--if, by that term, we
   understand mechanisms of give-and-take and persuasion by means of which
   we govern ourselves. It is, rather, a certain kind of mass delusion.

   A big part of the problem is virtue signaling. Only certain kinds of
   (immoral) people would refuse to go along with these delusions, and too
   many of us wish not to be thought of as being one of those people, so
   we avoid expressing skepticism publicly. To do so--to repeat things
   being said by those who scoff at the outrage of the day and are thought
   to be racists--risks devaluing one's reputation among "progressives."

   My theory of political correctness: a cognitive and intellectual dead
   end where too many people are motivated to remain silent on critical
   questions, to voice empty platitudes, or even to say things that they
   don't believe, all by their need to avoid appearing as though they're
   on the wrong side of history.[[159]10]

Those Who Downplay Behavioral Disparities Are Bluffing

   People on the left of American politics who claim that "white
   supremacy," "implicit bias," and old-fashioned discrimination account
   for black disadvantage are daring you to disagree. Their implicit
   rebuke is that, if you do not agree, you are saying that there's
   something intrinsically wrong with black people, or with black culture;
   you must be a racist who thinks that blacks are inferior. Otherwise,
   they say, how else could one explain the disparities? Behavior? That
   leads to the accusation that you are "blaming the victim."

   But this is a bluff. It is a rhetorical sleight-of-hand, a debater's
   trick. Why? Consider a statement that "mass incarceration," the high
   number of blacks in jails and prisons, is self-evidently a sign of
   American racism. If you respond that it's mainly a sign of the
   pathological behavior of criminals who happen to be black, you risk
   being called a racist. Yet common sense, not to mention the evidence,
   suggests that people are not being arrested, tried, convicted, and
   sentenced because they are black. Rather, prisons are full of people
   who have broken the law, who have hurt other people, who have violated
   the basic rules of civility. Prison is not a conspiracy to confine
   black people. I maintain that no serious person believes that it is.
   Not really.

   The young black men taking one another's lives on the streets of St.
   Louis, Baltimore, and Chicago are exhibiting behavioral pathology,
   plain and simple. The people they kill are mainly black, and the
   families who live with the misery are mainly black. Ascribing that to
   white racism is laughable. Nobody believes it. Not really.

   Consider educational test-score data. Antiracism advocates are, in
   effect, daring you to say that some groups send their children to the
   elite universities in outsize numbers compared with other groups
   because their academic preparation is magnitudes higher and better.
   Such excellence is an achievement.[[160]11]

   One is not born with the knowledge, skills, and academic ability to
   gain admission into elite colleges. The people who acquire these skills
   do so through effort. Why do some youngsters acquire the skills while
   others do not? That is a deep question requiring a serious answer. The
   simple answer--that this disparity is due to racism, and anyone who
   says otherwise is a racist--is not serious. Do such disparate outcomes
   have nothing to do with behavior, with cultural patterns, with what
   peer groups value, with how people spend their time, with what they
   identify as being critical to their self-respect? Anyone who believes
   that is, at best, a fool.

   Asians are said, sardonically, to be a "model minority." As a matter of
   fact, quite a compelling case can be made that "culture" is critical to
   their success. Jennifer Lee and Min Zhou interviewed Asian families in
   Southern California, trying to learn how their kids get into Dartmouth,
   Columbia, and Cornell at such high rates.[[161]12] They found that
   these families do exhibit cultural patterns, embrace values, adopt
   practices, engage in behavior, and follow disciplines that orient them
   so as to facilitate the achievements of their children. It defies
   common sense, as well as the evidence, to assert that they do not, or,
   conversely, to assert that the paucity of African-Americans performing
   at the very top of the intellectual spectrum--I am talking about
   academic excellence and about the low relative numbers of blacks who
   exhibit it--has nothing to do with behavior, that it is due entirely to
   institutional forces. That is an absurdity.

   Some 70% of African-American babies are born to a woman without a
   husband. Is this a good thing? Is it due to the ongoing practice of
   antiblack racism? Some people say these things. Do they really believe
   these things, or are they daring you to deny them?

   The 21st-century failures of too many African-Americans to take
   advantage of the opportunities created by the civil rights revolution
   are palpable, yet they are denied at every turn. This position is
   untenable. The end of Jim Crow segregation and the advent of equal
   rights for blacks were game changers. A half-century later, the deep
   disparities that remain are shameful and are due in large part to the
   behaviors of black people.

   People tout the racial wealth gap as, ipso facto, an indictment of the
   system--even while black Caribbean and African immigrants are starting
   businesses, penetrating the professions, and presenting themselves at
   Ivy League institutions in outsize numbers. They are behaving, although
   black, like other immigrant groups in our nation's past. True, they are
   immigrants, not natives, and immigration can be positively selectived.
   But something is dreadfully wrong when adverse patterns of behavior
   readily visible in the black American population go without being
   adequately discussed--to the point that anybody daring to mention them
   is labeled a racist.

   Thus, the Obama administration's Department of Education issued a "Dear
   Colleague Letter"[[162]13] that sought to cajole local school districts
   around the country to narrow the racial disparity in the suspension
   rates of students for disruptive behavior. The letter was supposedly
   advice--but failure to narrow the disparity meant that the district
   could be found guilty of a civil rights violation and potentially lose
   federal funding. Trump's secretary of education, Betsy DeVos, rescinded
   that letter--resulting in a great deal of consternation.

   Of course, if teachers, principals, guidance counselors, and
   school-based police officers are discriminating by race when they
   discipline students, the Department of Education and the Department of
   Justice should get involved. But based on all that we know--for
   instance, about crime and incarceration rates--it is at least plausible
   that there is an objective racial disparity in the frequency of
   disruptive behavior that occasions a difference in the suspension
   statistics. If behavior, not racism, is at the bottom of racially
   disparate suspension rates, think of the disservice being done--to the
   schoolchildren who act out (by failing to teach the lesson that bad
   behavior has consequences), to classmates (including, of course,
   minority students) who are hindered from getting an education by
   disruptive classroom behavior, and to teachers, who are trying to
   maintain a safe environment for learning.

   One more example of how this bluffing can do harm: the
   affirmative-action debate. We are now on the verge of permanently
   including African-Americans in elite and selective academic
   institutions through an openly acknowledged use of different standards.
   That is horrible--and not because of the Fourteenth Amendment, though
   the Supreme Court may yet find it so. It's horrible because this is not
   equality. It is patronizing. It is horrible for black Americans to
   embrace, and the establishment to adopt, a set of practices rooted in
   the soft bigotry of low expectations. Yet other than Clarence Thomas,
   Thomas Sowell, and a few others, there is not even a debate among
   African-Americans about what should be a first-order question, if the
   goal is to attain genuine racial equality.

No Responsibility Means No Glory

   If the negative cultural patterns in some African-American communities
   are said to be a necessary consequence of oppression, what is one to
   make of positive cultural patterns of behavior? Are they, too, a
   necessary consequence of oppression? If an individual or a community
   refuses to take responsibility for failure, how can they claim any
   glory for success? No blame? No skin in the game? Then no credit.

   You cannot help the hand you are dealt; but you can decide how to play
   it. To cast oneself as a helpless victim, to filter experience
   constantly and at every instance through a sieve that catches
   everything that one has control over while leaving the outcome to
   invisible, implacable historical forces: something is pathetic about
   that posture.

   The struggle for equal rights for black people, from abolition through
   the civil rights movement, has always been thought of as a "freedom
   struggle." But with freedom, rightly understood, comes responsibility.
   It is past time for all of us to start performing without a net. Rather
   than lamenting the lack of black billionaires, an outcome ascribed to
   some invisible force called "racism," one can admit that you will never
   become a billionaire unless you build a billion-dollar business--which
   begins by starting a business. One will never win a Nobel Prize in
   physics unless one learns calculus at the age of 12. What black parents
   are insisting that their 12-year-old kids learn calculus--those few
   kids capable of doing so? White people are not responsible for the fact
   that black people are, or are not, doing this.

Not All Black People Are the Same

   All this having been said about the behavioral roots of racial
   inequality, it is dangerous to talk about "black culture" as if it were
   only one thing--with pathological behavior (such as high levels of
   urban violence) becoming a stereotype about all black people. Here an
   insight by UCLA sociologist Rogers Brubaker is crucial for
   understanding race and inequality: one should never invoke racial
   aggregates as the subjects of social analysis unreflectively.[[163]14]

   This is a major concern among African-Americans about "culture talk."
   Culture talk overly focuses on pathology; but many positive things
   could be mentioned that will not typically appear in an op-ed. Black
   people are not a this or a that. They are a population in excess of 30
   million, with cultural patterns as variegated as one would expect in
   such a large aggregation.

   Moreover, American society is a polyglot mixture where cultural
   dynamics influence one another. For example, some middle-class,
   suburban white kids download rap music produced by black artists from
   the inner city. These musicians come to have a market substantially
   influenced by the preferences of their middle-class white customers. To
   a certain degree, they play to that audience, including that audience's
   stereotypes about thuggish behavior. Along comes a schoolteacher who
   announces: "Rap music is bad, and it's pathological. Can't you see just
   how troubled black people are?" This is ludicrous--how is it that a few
   hundred musicians and artists responding to a national market
   consisting mostly of white customers suddenly become emblematic of
   black culture or black people?

   Another example involves the drug trade, which in the U.S. is worth
   billions of dollars annually and includes marijuana, heroin, cocaine,
   ecstasy, and crystal meth. It involves people of every race in every
   geographic location and every walk of life. But the street trafficking
   in drugs in large urban areas is largely in the hands of black and
   Latino youth--in substantial part because the only people who would do
   such dangerous, low-paying work are those whose alternative employment
   opportunities are scant. It is no surprise that those incarcerated for
   street-level trafficking are disproportionately blacks. Their arrests
   and imprisonment are not in themselves evidence of racism--or evidence
   of black culture. But given the bare facts of racial stigma in American
   society, many observers will be inclined to think so.

We're All in This Together--at Least We're Supposed to Be

   This point about racial stigma is fundamental. Without understanding
   it, one might say (as many conservative commentators do), "Look at
   recent immigrants from Asia and even from Latin America. They, too,
   have been victims in various ways. Yet they have advanced in our
   society even as the blacks of inner-city Detroit, Chicago,
   Philadelphia, Baltimore, New Orleans, Los Angeles, and Oakland continue
   to lag. Whatever is wrong with those people?" In effect: "It must be
   something about `those people,' not about us, that causes them to be so
   backward."

   By looking at America this way, one eschews social, political, and
   moral responsibility for the plight of those people. One will conclude
   that blacks' failure to develop their human potential reflects the
   absence of such potential (and there are books making that argument),
   or it reflects a backward culture that, sadly but inevitably ("What
   more can we do?") causes them to lag behind. Yet blacks are not the
   authors of the stigma that engenders developmental bias against them.
   When we understand that the way people come to value things or make
   decisions is partly created via interactions in society, their
   flourishing, or lack thereof, reflects on society as a whole, as well
   as on themselves. It reflects on an "us," not merely on "them."

   The mistake is to ignore the extent to which racial inequality reflects
   not only cultural patterns among insular groups of people but also the
   interactions that run through society. To impute a causal role to what
   one takes to be intrinsic cultural traits of a subordinate racial
   group, while failing to see the systemwide context out of which
   dysfunctional cultural patterns emerged, is to commit a significant
   error of social cognition. That members of a particular group seem to
   perform less well routinely on a set of transactions of interest is a
   matter not of a cultural essence but of the network of social relations
   that has (or has not) prepared the members of that group for those
   transactions.

   In the U.S. context, "blackness" is associated with stigmatizing
   meanings. This stigma leads nonblack people to be reluctant to enter
   into intimate social or individual relations with them, which in turn
   affects the social allocation of developmental resources.

   People don't make social judgments based on straightforward
   benefit-cost calculations. Rather, they often act on identity
   considerations. They ask such questions as: Who am I? How should I
   live? With whom should I associate? When should I extend to this
   "other" a benefit of the doubt? Racial inequality is, in substantial
   part, the outcome of a system of nonmarket social interactions such as
   these that entangle us together.

   Consider the high out-of-wedlock birthrates among blacks. This pattern
   of behavior has consequences for socioeconomic racial disparities. But
   that is not the whole story.

   Racial intermarriage rates in the U.S. remain quite low (though they
   have risen in recent decades).[[164]15] The reasons for this low rate
   are unclear. Are black women, perhaps, receiving marriage proposals
   from white men and turning them down? I don't know. But I strongly
   suspect that a low rate of cross-boundary mating between these two
   groups has implications for human development, for resources available
   to children, and for the generation and transmission of wealth.

   Moreover, the low rate of intermarriage has implications for the dating
   and mating market among blacks because they are a small minority of the
   population--roughly one in eight Americans. If white men and black
   women were marrying at a higher rate, black men and black women would
   be interacting in a different way. To observe a social equilibrium in
   which blacks and whites exhibit different out-of-wedlock birthrates
   and, on the basis of that observation, to impute the difference to
   something called black culture, reflects one's failure to see how the
   intra-racial marriage market is nested within a larger context, where a
   higher rate of cross-boundary mating could substantially alter
   intra-boundary behavior.

   What may be perceived as a characteristic of "those people" (Why don't
   they marry? Why do they bear their children in such a disorderly
   manner?) might be seen instead as a question about society as a whole.
   From the perspective of the white population, perhaps the real question
   about out-of-wedlock births is: "Why do we avoid intimacy with them?" I
   use "us," "we," "them" to emphasize how stigma operates. It operates in
   the very definition of who one understands to be the social "we."

   How a society answers the question, "Who are we?" has far-reaching
   implications. When Americans talk about crime, violence, school
   failure, and urban decay, do we understand these matters as "us versus
   them"? If so, it becomes possible to say, regarding people languishing
   in the ghettos of our great cities: "That's not my country. That's some
   third-world thing."

   This was actually said during the flood of New Orleans that followed
   Hurricane Katrina. But black people have been in New Orleans for 250
   years. They're not aliens. They're as American as anybody can be. That
   was us crawling up on the rooftops. That was us huddled in the
   Superdome. The abject poverty that was exposed to a national audience
   after the flood was a quintessentially American affair, not simply a
   measure of the inadequacy of black culture. It reflected as well upon
   our social inadequacy.

   The perspective I am promoting about social capital does not require
   special, race-targeted social policy. Most policy initiatives aimed at
   improving the lives of our most disadvantaged citizens should not, and
   need not, be formulated in explicitly racial terms or understood as a
   remedy for racial injuries. We have to find what works for
   disadvantaged people in America, period. If we get that right--if we
   can fashion an American welfare state consistent with our demographic
   realities, our own values, and our fiscal capacities--we will go a very
   long way toward assisting African-Americans to develop their full human
   potential.

   Finding what works is especially pertinent for education policy.
   Disadvantaged youngsters who live in large cities are poorly served by
   the majority-minority school districts on which they and their parents
   must rely. This is a huge area for policy innovation, with respect to
   charter schools and increased options for parents. Yet black
   politicians who speak publicly on the issue are virtually unanimous in
   adopting the hostility toward charter schools that animates the
   country's largest teachers' union, the National Education Association.
   Thus, at the NAACP's annual board meeting in Cincinnati in 2016,
   delegates were overwhelmed by black American parents who had stormed
   the meeting to protest that the organization's board was about to
   endorse a resolution that opposed more funding for charter schools in
   various states.[[165]16]

   Are police good or bad for the security and safety of black lives in
   U.S. cities? It is hard to imagine a more important question. Yet one
   is hard-pressed to find any effective political debate among
   African-Americans. Instead, we get the shopworn and ineffective stances
   that people on the left are taking.

   Social-justice warriors are supposed to care about black lives. But if
   they did, they'd seriously care about securing the safety and property
   of African-Americans in the South Bronx, the west side of Chicago, and
   other cities. A real argument is to be had over public safety and the
   role of the police, and the answers are far from self-evident. Yet I'm
   not sure that social-justice warriors care about black lives. They seem
   to care more about remaining in lockstep with fashionable liberal
   opinion.

Conclusion: Who Are We?

   How should we think about the persistence of racial inequality in
   America? To deny the relevance of behavioral patterns among some black
   families and communities is folly. To wash one's hands of their
   problems because of such cultural and behavioral impediments is
   profoundly unjust. There are no easy answers, but I suggest that the
   view here is worth considering as a way to account for, and then
   respond to, an enduring dilemma that confronts and frustrates us still.

   Take the poor central-city dwellers who make up perhaps a quarter of
   the African-American population. The dysfunctional behavior of many in
   this population does account for much of their failure to progress--and
   conservatives' demand for greater personal responsibility is necessary
   and proper. Yet, confronted with the despair, violence, and
   self-destructive behavior of so many people, it seems morally
   superficial in the extreme to argue, as many conservatives do, that
   "those people should just get their acts together; if they did, like
   many of the poor immigrants, we would not have such a horrific problem
   in our cities." To the contrary, any morally astute response to the
   social pathology of American history's losers would have to conclude
   that, while we cannot change our ignoble past, we must not be
   indifferent to contemporary suffering issuing directly from that past.
   Their culture may be implicated in their difficulties, but so is our
   culture complicit in their troubles; we bear collective responsibility
   for the form and texture of our social relations.

   While we cannot ignore the behavioral problems of the so-called black
   underclass, we should discuss and react to those problems as if we were
   talking about our own children, neighbors, and friends. It will require
   adjusting ways of thinking on both sides of the racial divide.
   Achieving a well-ordered society, where all members are embraced as
   being among us, should be the goal. Our failure to do so is an American
   tragedy. It is a national, not merely a communal, disgrace. Changing
   the definition of the American "we" is a first step toward rectifying
   the relational discrimination that afflicts our society, and it is the
   best path forward in reducing racial inequality.
