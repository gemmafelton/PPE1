Are Asian Americans victims of racism or beneficiaries of whiteness? It's
complex.

It's time to discard this simplistic dichotomy.

   A question that seems to be asked with increasing frequency is whether
   Asian Americans are the beneficiaries of privileges historically
   afforded to white people in the United States or if we are the victims
   of racial discrimination. But reality is much more complex. It's time
   to discard this simplistic dichotomy.

   Take the [124]Students for Fair Admissions v[125]. Harvard case to be
   heard in the US Supreme Court in October. Plaintiffs in the case argue
   that Asian Americans experience racial discrimination in Harvard
   admissions, as evidenced, they claim, by admitted Asian American
   students' higher GPAs and SAT scores compared to admitted students of
   all other races, including white students. They also point to
   admissions officers' lower "personal" ratings of Asian American
   applicants compared to those of other students. Harvard and its
   defenders have responded in part by pointing to the [126]increasing
   percentage of Asian Americans admitted every year. The university also
   points out that academics are not the only criterion they use to admit
   students.

   In 2019, federal Judge Allison Burroughs [127]affirmed Harvard's
   admissions practices as legally sound in her ruling but also recognized
   the [128]possibility of anti-Asian discrimination in "personal"
   ratings. Asian Americans also experience [129]glass ceilings in
   corporate firms and [130]bullying in schools. Since the onset of the
   COVID-19 pandemic, Asian Americans have experienced increased
   [131]physical attacks. It's clear that anti-Asian discrimination is
   real. A high percentage of Asian American students admitted to Harvard
   does not preclude the possibility of anti-Asian racism.

   On the other hand, Asian Americans' overall high SAT scores and GPAs
   are driven, in part, by privileges made for and normally afforded to
   middle-class white Americans. Many Asian Americans have been able to
   benefit from these advantages. Why? US immigration policy has meant
   that [132]a large proportion of immigrants from Asia come with college
   and even graduate degrees. High incomes enable a significant number of
   them to move to [133]well-off suburbs historically designed as islands
   of privilege for upper-middle-class white people leaving
   [134]integrated cities.

   Those municipalities have, for decades, been able to offer a top-notch
   public education -- they can provide more opportunities given their
   high tax bases -- and they have fewer poverty-related challenges to
   address, as well. Those advantages -- along with highly skilled Asian
   parents' dexterity in educational testing (that's what got them into
   top colleges in Asia) and [135]positive stereotypes teachers often have
   about Asian Americans' academic capability -- facilitate Asian American
   kids' high levels of academic achievement. In this regard, Asian
   Americans do indeed benefit from [136]"whiteness" as a system of
   advantage. In other words, the US education system has racially unequal
   opportunities and hence outcomes baked into it, and Asian Americans
   have actually benefited from that racial inequality that historically
   has privileged white students over Black and Latinx students.

   Taking this history into account when making admissions decisions means
   we'd expect Asian American and white students' SAT scores and GPAs to
   be higher than those of Black, Latinx, and Native American students on
   average. Of course, [137]Asian Americans are diverse, and working-class
   Asian Americans do not experience the benefits of living in well-off
   neighborhoods, even if [138]some may benefit from teachers' positive
   stereotypes about Asian Americans' academic capabilities.

   I found these dual forces of race operating in [139]my own research in
   a well-off East Coast suburb with a large and growing Asian American
   population. This was a town that, [140]like many affluent suburbs
   around the country -- from San Jose, Calif., to Weston, Mass. -- had
   many years ago passed laws to prevent working-class people from moving
   in, such as minimum housing lot size requirements and limits on the
   building of multifamily homes. The historical record shows that laws
   like these and [141]the choices many white Americans made (and continue
   to make) about where to live were frequently related to a desire to
   steer clear of Black people in particular. Many suburban properties
   even had explicit racially restrictive covenants, which barred the sale
   of those properties to Black buyers. These covenants were legal until
   the Fair Housing Act of 1968.

   Even today, Black middle-class professionals frequently do not choose
   to live in towns like the one I studied, in part because [142]they
   understand the problems likely to ensue if their children do not have
   peers who share their racial identity. [143]Racial steering by real
   estate agents also keeps them away.

   But Asian Americans have had a different experience in the United
   States. The history of residential segregation between Black and white
   Americans, ironically, enabled Asian American professionals to reap the
   benefits of living in communities segregated by class and previously by
   race. Some see evidence like this as meaning that Asian Americans are
   "white adjacent."

   But [144]in my research I also found evidence of anti-Asian racism.
   Many white parents expressed disdain for Asian American parenting,
   which, they observed, enabled Asian American students to outperform
   white students academically. For example, one white mom complained to
   me about the presence of kids whose parents had academic standards she
   deemed unreasonably high, describing one to me by saying, "her name is
   not Sally Smith. ... It's never the blonde Norwegian."

   To be sure, anti-Asian American racism is not the same as anti-Black
   racism. The two are driven by different stereotypes and appear in
   different spheres of social life. There is no point in trying to
   measure whether one is "worse" than the other. They are different, and
   we must find ways for both to end.

   To do so, we must stop assuming that Asian American academic
   achievement means the end of anti-Asian racism or that Asian Americans
   sometimes benefiting from privileges previously reserved for white
   Americans means we always benefit from the privileges of whiteness. The
   multifaceted nature of racial discrimination and privilege in the
   United States is far more complex. To tackle it, we need to understand
   its diverse faces.
