South Africa network tackles racial discrimination

   19 November 2015

   About 60 civil society organisations have joined the Ahmed Kathrada
   Foundation and the Nelson Mandela Foundation to plan and hold an
   anti-racism awareness week to be held in March next year.

   The initiative falls under the Anti-Racism Network South Africa
   (ARNSA), which was launched on 14 November. The ARNSA is spearheaded by
   the Ahmed Kathrada Foundation and the Nelson Mandela Foundation, says
   organisers, and it aims to fight racism and related forms of
   discrimination on a national scale, using the collective weight of
   multiple organisations.

   The anti-racism week will lead up to 21 March, recognised locally as
   Human Rights Day and globally as the International Day for the
   Elimination of Racial Discrimination.

The main speaker

   At the ARNSA launch, held at Museum Africa in Newtown, Johannesburg,
   Professor Achille Mbembe spoke about racism in South Africa at the
   moment.

     Mbembe – #nonracialism helped to sustain a horizon of hope and was a
     means of mobilisation. #ARNSA

     Mbembe – we can say things ‘must fall’, but what must rise? #ARNSA

     — Kathrada Foundation (@KathradaFound) November 14, 2015

   Sean Moodley, the ARNSA’s convenor, emphasised the importance of
   organisations pooling resources to establish a national initiative.
   “The launch of the network will signify to us the work and thought
   processes that have gone into a collaborative effort to eliminate
   racism. We cannot combat racism alone. The fall of apartheid was
   brought about by collaboration between a range of organisations.

   “We are confident that though this network, we will see a more
   co-ordinated approach to addressing racism, so that we will now have
   the kind of institutional capacity to tackle the problem nationally,”
   he said.

   Also on the table are suggestions regarding an awareness campaign aimed
   at educating ordinary South Africans on how to use Equality Courts to
   take up complaints of racism.
