Continue to explore racial discrimination issues in Sweden and the United
States through our additional content

   On March 21st The Raoul Wallenberg together with Kino organised the
   [51]second event of the Swedish Human Rights Film Festival. We marked
   the International Day for the Elimination of Racial Discrimination with
   a panel discussion on racial discrimination in Sweden and the US. Aysha
   Jones, Founder of the Black Lives Matter and Irene Molina, Pr. in Human
   Geography at Uppsala University offered us their views on this very
   topical subject.
