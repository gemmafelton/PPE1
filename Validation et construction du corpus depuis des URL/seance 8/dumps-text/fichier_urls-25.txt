   International Day for the Elimination of Racial Discrimination

   International Day for the Elimination of Racial Discrimination

   AFRICA
     * racism
     * human rights
     * Pope Francis

        No to racial discrimination, even in times of war and pandemics.

   Since 1966, every 21 March has been commemorated as the International
   Day for the Elimination of Racial Discrimination, established by the
   United Nations in remembrance of the massacre in Sharpeville, South
   Africa. Last year, Pope Francis defined racism as “a virus that quickly
   mutates and, instead of disappearing, goes into hiding.”

   Andrea De Angelis - Vatican City

   Sometimes racism expresses itself in silence. The eloquent glance that
   does not conceal a discriminatory attitude. Words then merely reinforce
   this lowest concept of the human race. Every year on 21 March, we
   celebrate International Day for the Elimination of Racial
   Discrimination. With the pandemic and more than one war going on -
   Ukraine, Ethiopia, Syria and Yemen - this day takes on special
   significance.

What happened 62 years ago?

   The day is celebrated every year on this date to remember what happened
   on 21 March 1960 in South Africa. At the height of apartheid, the
   police opened fire on black demonstrators, killing 69 and wounding
   about three times that number. It was a dramatic episode, indelibly
   remembered in history as the Sharpeville Massacre. In proclaiming this
   International Day in 1966, the United Nations General Assembly, in its
   Resolution 2142, stressed the need for more significant efforts to
   eliminate all forms of racial discrimination. A mission certainly not
   exhausted.

Desmond Tutu: the “power of peace” is his legacy

   Anglican Archbishop Desmond Tutu

   This year the day came less than three months after the death of
   Anglican Archbishop Desmond Tutu, who died on 26 December at the age of
   90. A symbol of the struggle against Apartheid in South Africa, he won
   the Nobel Peace Prize in 1984. The committee for the world’s most
   prestigious peace award cited Tutu’s “role as a unifying leader in the
   non-violent campaign to resolve the problem of apartheid in South
   Africa.” Two years later, he became the first black person to lead the
   Anglican Church in South Africa on 7 September 1986. The Archbishop was
   a man of peace, a servant of Christ inspired by the African concept
   of ubuntu, a vision of society that espouses the belief in a universal
   bond of sharing that connects all humanity. It is essentially about
   togetherness and how all of our actions impact others and society for
   the promotion and maintenance of peace.

The words of Pope Francis

   “Racism is a virus that quickly mutates and, instead of disappearing,
   goes into hiding and lurks in waiting. Instances of racism continue to
   shame us, for they show that our supposed social progress is not as
   real or definitive as we think.”

   Pope Francis with some young African migrants.

   This is what Pope Francis wrote precisely one year ago on his Twitter
   profile on 21 March. No to racism, yes to welcoming migrants. No to
   nationalism, yes to European values and peace. These were the contents
   of Francis’ message in his audience with participants of the Plenary
   Assembly of the Pontifical Academy of Social Sciences in May 2019. “The
   Church,” said the Pope, “observes with concern the re-emergence,
   somewhat throughout the world, of aggressive tendencies toward
   foreigners, types of migrants, as well as that growing nationalism that
   disregards the common good.” He added, “This risks compromising
   previously consolidated forms of international cooperation, threatens
   the aims of international organisations as spaces for dialogue and
   encounter for all countries on a level of mutual respect, and prevents
   the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals,” set by the UN.

   Again, in his address to participants at the Xenophobia, Racism and
   Populist Nationalism in the context of global migration conference in
   September 2018, the Pope stated:

   We live in times in which feelings that to many had seemed to be
   outdated appear to be reemerging and spreading. Feelings of suspicion,
   fear, contempt and even hatred towards other individuals or groups
   judged to be different on the basis of their ethnicity, nationality or
   religion, and as such, believed not to be sufficiently worthy to
   participate fully in the life of society. These feelings, then, too
   often inspire real acts of intolerance, discrimination or exclusion
   that seriously harm the dignity of those involved as well as their
   fundamental rights, including the very right to life and to physical
   and moral integrity. Unfortunately, in the political world, too, it
   happens that one gives in to the temptation to exploit the fears and
   the objective difficulties of some groups and to make misleading
   promises out of shortsighted electoral interests. The seriousness of
   these phenomena cannot leave us indifferent. We are all called, in our
   respective roles, to nurture and promote respect for the inherent
   dignity of every human person beginning with the family — the place in
   which we learn from a very tender age the values of sharing, welcoming,
   brotherhood and solidarity — but also in the various social contexts we
   engage in.

Absolutely intolerable

   Last June, addressing an urgent debate convened at the UN in Geneva as
   part of the 43rd session of the Human Rights Council, on the topic of,
   “The current racially-inspired human rights violations, systemic
   racism, police brutality against people of African descent and violence
   against peaceful demonstrations,” the Holy See’s Permanent Observer to
   the United Nations, Archbishop Ivan Jurkovič, urged all states to,
   “recognise, defend and promote the fundamental human rights of every
   person,” calling “racial discrimination in all its forms absolutely
   intolerable.” Indeed, “all members of the human family, made in the
   image and likeness of God are equal in their inherent dignity,
   regardless of his or her race, nation, sex, origin, culture or
   religion.”

   Archbishop Jurkovič ended his statement by quoting Pope Francis’s words
   during the General Audience of 3 June 2020: “We cannot tolerate or turn
   a blind eye to racism and exclusion in any form and yet claim to defend
   the sacredness of every human life,” he said.

   Diversity. Diversity.

   Diversity.

Do not underestimate racism

   Father Giorgio Borroni, Director of Caritas Novara, was one of the
   signatories of a letter on racism that, in 2018, a group of clerics and
   laypersons wrote to the Italian Bishops urging them to intervene
   against the spread of an intolerant and racist culture. He stresses how
   racial discrimination should never be underestimated even in these
   difficult months that the world is currently undergoing. In times of
   pandemics and wars, racism should never be considered a secondary
   problem.

   “The Pope calls us to fraternity, to brotherhood and asks us as a
   society and as a Church, to meditate on the encyclical Fratelli tutti,
   which requires us to take concrete and effective steps forward,”
   explains Father Borroni in response to the question on the importance
   of the Day, which looks back at what happened in South Africa over half
   a century ago. “The pandemic has taught us that we are all
   interconnected in a global emergency, even if the responses have
   sometimes been discriminatory, and certainly not fair, for example, the
   distribution of Covid-19 vaccines,” he explained. “Even this war
   (Ukraine),” observed Fr Borroni, “has generated elements of
   discrimination and shown us that there exists (in the world) those in
   the A league and others in the B league. I am also thinking of the
   many, too many forgotten wars,” he said.

The PIME event

   Numerous events were organised in Italy and worldwide to commemorate
   this particular Day. One event organised in Italy by the PIME World
   Education Office offered a free online initiative entitled, Beyond
   Discrimination - faces and stories: Towards learning together and
   building a peaceful world.

   PIME, which stands for Pontifical Institute for Foreign Missions,
   dedicated the day to primary schools to promote the spirit of
   overcoming discrimination. The initiative, realised with the
   contribution of Fondazione Cariplo, was held on Monday 21 March from 9
   to 10 am on the PIME Centre’s YouTube channel. PIME educators sought to
   guide young viewers and listeners to reflect on this theme that is
   always topical. They demonstrated how it is possible to overcome
   divisions and build a world founded on peace. Subscribers listened to
   testimonies of Father Marco Ribolini and Father Daniele Criscione,
   missionaries in Thailand and the United States, respectively. There
   were also musical performances, videos and activities designed to
   involve children’s participation. Other activities comprised the music
   of Daniele Longo, an actor and musician as well as an introduction of
   the life of Archbishop Desmond Tutu.
