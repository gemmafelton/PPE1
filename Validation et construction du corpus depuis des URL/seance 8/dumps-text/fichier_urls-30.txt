“Race” and the Constitution: A South African perspective

   For a South African constitutional lawyer, watching from afar, the
   current debate in Germany on the removal of the word “race” from
   section 3 of article 3 of the German Basic Law, is perplexing. In the
   South African context, a similar call would widely be viewed as a
   regressive step aimed at protecting white privilege and reinforcing the
   social and economic dominance of the white minority. The South African
   and German contexts and histories differ, and the word “race” might
   have different connotations in German than it has in English, but it
   may nevertheless be of interest to consider why the words “race”, ^1)
    “racial” and “non-racialism” are mentioned in several provisions of
   the South African Constitution.

   The South African Constitution was drafted in response to the country’s
   history of colonial conquest and, later during the apartheid era, the
   legal enforcement of the system of racial segregation. South Africa’s
   Constitutional Court endorses this view and often invokes South
   Africa’s apartheid past when interpreting the provisions of the
   Constitution, stating that the Constitution is aimed at preventing the
   recurrence of past unjust practices. ^2) The specific references to
   “race” in the South African Constitution fulfil two functions. First,
   they aim to prevent the perpetuation of public and private forms of
   racial discrimination and racism. Second, they aim to address the
   effects of past and ongoing racial discrimination and racism by
   allowing or mandating race-based redress measures to correct the racial
   injustices of the past. To illustrate, I will now discuss some of the
   provisions in the South African Constitution that explicitly mention
   “race”.

   Section 9(3) of the Constitution prohibits “unfair discrimination”
   against anyone on one or more grounds, including on the ground of
   “race”. This section does not only bind the state, but also private
   parties, in recognition of the fact that racism and racial
   discrimination lingers on long after the abolition of discriminatory
   legislation and policies. (Some academic commentators critical of South
   Africa’s constitutional project go further, suggesting that racism and
   white supremacy are part of the foundation on which “Western
   constitutionalism” is built. ^3) The absence of any reference to “race”
   in the Constitution, so the argument goes, would create a
   constitutional silence about racism (especially by private parties) and
   its devastating effects. This is a silence that may well benefit the
   social and economically dominant group (which would be “white” people),
   by promoting the idea that the non-recognition of “race” would strike a
   blow against racism, when it would in fact serve to hide the problem of
   racism.

   The prohibition against racial discrimination contained in section 9(3)
   of the Constitution, must be read in conjunction with section 9(2). The
   latter section specifically permits the state to take redress measures
   “designed to protect or advance persons, or categories of persons,
   disadvantaged by unfair discrimination may be taken”. Such measures
   include so called “affirmative action” measures based on “race”. The
   drafters of the Constitution insisted on the inclusion of this
   provision to ensure the Constitution did not prevent the state and
   other parties from addressing the effects of past and continued racial
   discrimination and racism. Section 9(2) is based on the premise that
   the abolition of racial discrimination does not automatically lead the
   eradication of racism and of racial discrimination by both the state
   and by private parties. (As the global protests under the banner of
   “Black Lives Matter” illustrate, informal or private racism and racial
   discrimination against black people also persist across the globe,
   despite the absence of racially discriminating legislation or
   policies.)

   Section 9(3) and 9(2), must also be read in conjunction with section
   9(1) which provides that: “Everyone is equal before the law and has the
   right to equal protection and benefit of the law.” South Africa’s
   Constitutional Court held in Minister of Finance v Van Heerden that
   there was no conflict between the general claim to equality before the
   law, on the one hand, and the enforcement of race-based redress
   measures on the other. This is because race-based redress measures were
   not, as some critics argue, a form of “reverse discrimination” or
   “positive discrimination”, but a requirement to achieve the goal of
   equality before the law.^. In this view, in order to achieve equality,
   it is essential to recognise the concept of “race” and to use it to
   undo the effects of past and ongoing racism and racial discrimination.
   The Constitutional Court explained in Minister of Finance v Van Heerden
   that:

   “the provisions of section 9(1) and section 9(2) are complementary;
   both contribute to the constitutional goal of achieving equality to
   ensure “full and equal enjoyment of all rights”… Equality before the
   law protection in section 9(1) and measures to promote equality in
   section 9(2) are both necessary and mutually reinforcing but may
   sometimes serve distinguishable purposes.”

   “Race” is also mentioned in section 16(1) of the Constitution. Section
   16  guarantees for everyone the right to freedom of expression.
   However, section 16(2) lists types of expression that are not
   protected, and this excluded expression includes (in section 16(2)(c))
   “advocacy of hatred that is based on race”, and “that constitutes
   incitement to cause harm”. Once again, the section recognises the
   harmful effects of racism and invoke “race” as a category to allow the
   legislature to pass legislation to protect individuals against the
   effect of racial hatred.

   Other provisions in the Constitution also permit “race” to be taken
   into account when appointing individuals to various institutions. Most
   notably, section 174(2) of the Constitution states that the “need for
   the judiciary to reflect broadly the racial and gender composition of
   South Africa must be considered when judicial officers are appointed”.
   At the time when this provision was adopted, more than 90% of South
   African judges were “white” and male, despite the fact that less than
   10% of the population are “white”. The provision was included to help
   correct this historical injustice, caused again by formal racial
   discrimination during the apartheid era and lingering racism after
   apartheid laws were abolished.

   Given the various constitutional provisions referencing “race”, and
   given the jurisprudence of South Africa’s Constitutional Court, it was
   not surprising when last week a court, while considering whether
   regulations allowing the government to use “race” as one of the
   criteria in allocating Covid-19 related financial aid, affirmed that
   the South African Constitution, read as a whole, “cannot be construed
   as a libertarian constitution” ^4) nor as a “race-neutral”
   Constitution. To ignore race, according to the court,  would be to
   ignore the country’s “egregious history in which race overlaid by class
   and gender was the central determinants of the distribution of
   resources in our society for more than 300 years of its existence.”

   The fact that the South African Constitution is not “race-neutral” does
   not mean that “race” ought to guide the manner in which relations among
   people in society should be structured in the long run. The long term
   aim of the Constitution is to create a “non-racial” society in which
   the importance of “race” would fade away. This is why section 1 of the
   Constitution lists “non-racialism” as one of the founding values of the
   Constitution. (Section 1 is “super entrenched” and can only be amended
   with a 75% majority vote in the lower house of Parliament.)

   Non-racialism means different things to different people. ^5) It could
   denote a belief that “race” does not exist and that the law should not
   recognise “race” in any form to categorise people or their experiences.
   This view is often dismissed by South African scholars as a “colour
   blind” approach which denies the reality that race – and its twin,
   “racism” – have a profound impact on people’s lives and their
   life-chances. ^6)

   South Africa’s Constitutional Court has adopted another view on
   non-racialism which is also the dominant view in South African
   political discourse. In this view “non-racialism” is an ideal, but one
   that can only be reached by accepting the reality that “race” has a
   profound effect on how we view people, how the world is arranged, and
   what life-chances individuals enjoy. In other words, in order to create
   a non-racial society, it is necessary to acknowledge and deal with the
   effects of lingering racism and formal and informal racial
   discrimination. To do that, one has to acknowledge that “race”
   continues to have real-life consequences. The Constitutional Court
   explained this in in its 2004 judgment in Minister of Finance and Other
   v Van Heerden as follows:

   “However, it is also clear that the long-term goal of our society is a
   non-racial, non-sexist society in which each person will be recognised
   and treated as a human being of equal worth and dignity. Central to
   this vision is the recognition that ours is a diverse society,
   comprised of people of different races, different language groups,
   different religions and both sexes. This diversity, and our equality as
   citizens within it, is something our Constitution celebrates and
   protects.”

   One way to understand this approach is to distinguish, on the one hand,
   between the notion that “race” is an invented or constructed concept
   which does not say anything profound or accurate about any human being,
   and, on the other hand, the idea that “race” may be an invented
   concept, but nevertheless has material effects, which means avoiding
   the use of “race” as a legal concept would make it difficult, if not
   impossible, for the law to respond to the consequences of racism and
   white supremacy.

   In this view “race” has been used in the past, and continues to be used
   (also by private parties), to discriminate directly and indirectly
   against people who are “black”. “Race” may be a construct, but to
   ignore the many ways in which “race” impacts on the lived reality of
   those on the receiving end of racism and racial discrimination, is to
   condone existing racial inequality. This view is captured by former
   Chief Justice Ngcobo in the judgment of Bato Star Fishing (Pty) Ltd v
   The Minister of Environmental Affairs and Tourism and Others where he
   states:

   “In this fundamental way, our Constitution differs from other
   constitutions which assume that all are equal and in so doing simply
   entrench existing inequalities. Our Constitution recognises that
   decades of systematic racial discrimination entrenched by the apartheid
   legal order cannot be eliminated without positive action being taken to
   achieve that result. We are required to do more than that. The effects
   of discrimination may continue indefinitely unless there is a
   commitment to end it.” At the heart of this approach is an
   acknowledgement that the constitutional claim that everyone is equal
   before the law is the expression of an ideal, not a description of
   reality. Everyone is not equal before the law, partly because of the
   way in which “race” and racism impact differently on different people.
   In this view, the claim that we are all equal before the law – while
   racism, among other things, makes this impossible – and that “race”
   does not exist, is a dangerous one as it may serve to hide the many
   different ways in which racism impacts on people who are not “white”.
   In short, this is a view that a “colour-blind” approach to “race”
   inevitably leads to turning a blind eye to racism and its consequences.

       The German reality, at least in my personal experience, is that
       many Germans consider the application of the term ‚race‘ on humans
       to be part of the problem. Until recently, when someone talked
       about race you could be pretty sure it was a racist. Recently this
       has changed a little, probably in part because due to the influence
       of English the term is now used a lot in the context of
       anti-racism. But personally I still feel very uneasy when anyone
       uses this word, and I am sure the use of the word in our
       constitution is because ’scientific racism‘ was still in the heads
       of most people in the late 1940s.
       I guess one could say that ‚race‘ and the German word ‚Rasse‘ are
       not precise translations of each other nowadays, although they once
       were and may become so again. But for now, the German word has
       extremely strong connotations of antisemitism and extermination
       camps and only faint connotations of affirmative action or the
       like.

       Thank you for this interesting perspective!
       The current German debate is misunderstood when the proposal by the
       Greens and others to reform section 3 of article 3 of the German
       Basic Law is coined a „removal“ of the word „race“. Sometimes this
       even seems to happen on purpose (straw man argument).
       The real debate is about replacing the prohibition of
       discrimination „because of race“ by prohibiting „racist“
       discrimination. Why and how would this be a “colour-blind” approach
       that should be considered problematic?

       Thank you as well for the interesting article!
       While I read it I alredy planned to write the same comment like
       Philipp.
       Actually I am intensly involved in that theme because of my work.
       Like Philipp writes the idea is to replace „Rasse“ with
       rassistisch. The word rassistisch shows clearly that there is the
       Problem of Racism, but it also states that there is no „race“. By
       doing that we dont ignore the Problem; we actually show clearly
       that it is one. It also should be noted in this context that the
       „Parlamentarischer Rat“ (which wrote the Grundgesetz), in its still
       existing comments still was convinced that there are races, but
       that it shouldnt be a reason for discrimination any more. The
       discussion right now is important to show that nowadays this
       changed and we know that there is no „race“. The problem becomes
       obvious in this article (like in many scientific ones) when you
       read footnote number one. The word „race“ or „Rasse“ you only can
       use in inverted commas and by making clear that its a construct.
       With the word rassistisch you dont have to do that.
       The impuls to replace the word „Rasse“ is by the way already years
       old and comes from the left originally.
