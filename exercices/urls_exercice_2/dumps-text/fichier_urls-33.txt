   Irish budget airline Ryanair (FR/RYR) has been accused of racial
   discrimination after forcing passengers holding South African passports
   to fill out a questionnaire in Afrikaans (A language used by less than
   14% of South Africans) before being allowed to board their flights.

   Afrikaans is just one of 11 languages used in South Africa which also
   includes English and isiZulu. For Africans of colour, Afrikaans has
   deep connotations as the use of Afrikaans was enforced during the
   Apartheid years and for many is a symbol of racism and division.

   One passenger described the test as “exclusionary” after being forced
   to take it before a flight to Ibiza, South African Zinhle Novazi told
   the financial times “they didn’t think about the implications”.

   According to The Metro, English speaker Dinesh Joseph, asked for a form
   in English after originally being given one in Afrikaans to be told
   “this is your language”!

   Ryanair defended forcing passengers travelling with South African
   Passports to use Afrikaans saying it was to prevent fraudulent passport
   use.

   The Airline said: “We require passengers travelling to the UK to fill
   out a simple questionnaire issued in Afrikaans. If they are unable to
   complete this questionnaire, they will be refused travel and issued
   with a full refund”.
