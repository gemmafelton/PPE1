   The U.S. has an ambivalent history with CERD. It signed the treaty in
   1966, but Congress did not ratify it for nearly three decades -- until
   Oct. 21, 1994. And while the treaty commits the U.S. to "adopt all
   necessary measures for speedily eliminating racial discrimination," the
   American Bar Association found in 2020 that the U.S. "has consistently
   failed to meaningfully uphold this mandate."
