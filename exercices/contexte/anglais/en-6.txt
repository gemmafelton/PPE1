   "The prevalence, and pervasiveness, of racial discrimination might make
   the situation look hopeless, but we remain hopeful. Let us expose the
   racism and racial discrimination endemic to every society, around the
   globe. Let us press forward, to root out that discrimination and remove
   the rot from our foundations. And on this day dedicated to ending
   racial discrimination, let us leave our children a less hateful, more
   hopeful world."

   -- U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations, Linda Thomas-Greenfield
