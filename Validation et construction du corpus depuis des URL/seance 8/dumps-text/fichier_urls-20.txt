South African lessons about racial discrimination

   'Whites only by order' sign attached to a park bench Last week marked
   the anniversary of the Sharpeville massacre which occurred during a
   protest against the pass laws. It ushered in increasingly
   discriminatory actions against Black South Africans, and can now be
   seen as the beginning of the end for the regime based on Apartheid.

   The South African experience suggests racial discrimination begins with
   the appropriation of wealth and power by one racial group and its
   consequent suppression of other groups in order to extend its wealth
   and power.

   The appropriation of power and wealth is naturally resisted by the
   existing inhabitants. In the course of struggle mutual incomprehension
   and fear grow, and the indigenous people are seen as strange,
   primitive, violent, childlike and less than fully human. This can be
   seen in the early pictorial representations of military or religious
   contact between native peoples and colonial representatives by Western
   artists. They leave no doubt which group has power and wealth, whether
   material or spiritual.

   After the dominant group has made secure its appropriation of wealth
   and power, it comes to assume that its dominance in these respects
   indicates its inherent superior capacity for power and entitlement to
   wealth. So the relations between the races are regulated in a way that
   provide lasting security in power and possessions for the dominant
   race. It controls and decides the fate of others; the native peoples
   are controlled and decided for.

   In South Africa the pass laws were designed to provide a reliable
   supply of cheap labour for industry, to ensure a homogeneous
   environment for white settlers in the cities, and security over the
   land they had occupied.

   In time as the initial conflict lessens and people have time for
   reflection these unequal and discriminatory relationships need
   ideological justification. Apartheid was just one of the more explicit
   ideologies. White and black peoples were seen as equal but different.
   So should each group have its own space, right down to separate park
   benches. The subtext, of course, was that one group of people was more
   equal than others. It was entitled to better conditions and could
   decide under what conditions other groups might live.

   Ideology usually leads to further discrimination because it allows
   people to act brutally with the shadow of a good conscience. In the
   name of apartheid millions of black people were forcibly moved from
   their homes into areas designated for them, pass laws were extended to
   cover women as well as men, and they lost what little rights they had
   to representation in Parliament.

   Ideology also leads to resistance both physically and on the level of
   ideas. Sharpeville is emblematic.

   The South African example is one of the most radical modern examples of
   racial discrimination. But the link between power and wealth and racial
   discrimination is expressed in other ways, too.

   Racial prejudice, for example, is fed by the fear of losing power and
   wealth to a new and apparently favoured group. Prejudice against
   immigrants and refugees, particularly if they are distinctive by race,
   colour or religion, is often expressed by people who feel themselves to
   struggle and lack control over their world. These feelings, which are
   also found among the affluent, can be manipulated by those who wish to
   maintain control over power and embodied in policies that are racially
   discriminatory.

   It follows that if we are to address racial prejudice and
   discrimination we need to examine the way in which wealth and power are
   distributed and protected in society. In Australia, as in most Western
   societies, wealth and power are being concentrated increasingly in the
   hands of fewer people and corporations. It is defended by the ideology
   of competitive individualism in a free and unregulated market. The
   threat to the process and ideology does not come from minority racial,
   religious or ethnic groups but from public awareness and revulsion.

   This threat is often met by directing popular frustration at
   powerlessness and inequality against minority groups, such as asylum
   seekers, Indigenous people and Muslims. A government can then act
   severely to control these perceived threats, so distracting attention
   from the ideology whose partiality creates frustration.

   If this is so the response to racial discrimination must be primarily
   to build an economic and political framework based on respect for the
   human dignity of each person, and on the understanding that the
   economic order must serve the good of all, particularly the most
   disadvantaged.

SUPPORT RESPECTFUL CONVERSATIONS IN A TIME OF DIVISION

   We need no reminding of the depth of the division that exists in our
   Australian community. It's there every time we go online, turn on the
   TV, open the newspaper.

   Our politics is focused on point-scoring, personalities, and
   name-calling across party lines. The media, for the most part, don't
   help, driven by the 24-hour news cycle and the pursuit of advertising
   dollars into a frenzy of click-bait and shallow sensationalism.

   What does it mean to be an Australian in times like these? What are the
   values that unite us?

   Eureka Street offers an alternative. It's less a magazine than a wide
   ranging conversation about the issues that matter in our country and
   our world; a conversation marked by respect for the dignity of all
   human beings.

   To do this, we rely on your support as our community and we thank you
   for giving it so generously.

   In 2002 writer J M Coetzee spoke about the apartheid years in South
   Africa: "The peculiar cruelty and horror of apartheid was the very
   un-African aspect of it, a very rigid and ordered and in a sense
   European derived system imposed on a country and society to which it
   was really petrifying...It is the contrast between the particular ugly,
   banal, systematic, cruel horror in an environment which is so huge and
   so lavishly beautiful." South African writers and artists contributed
   greatly to public awareness about the horrors of apartheid. And so with
   the powerlessness of minority groups here, our writers and artists and
   activists can continue to write, paint and agitate. More and more
   people will listen.

   But Andrew, the economic order in the capitalist west is not meant 'to
   serve the good of all', let alone the 'most disadvantaged'. Rather, t
   is meant to maximise and then concentrate total wealth, and the power
   that goes with it, in the hands of a few. The condition of the poor
   then becomes the natural result of their congenital sloth, while its
   relief is the object of discriminating charity. It has ever been thus.

   This is a very good article on racism. Well done. Keep up the good work

   thanks for this trenchant analysis and eye-opening reminder of a past
   that could become our future unless we act now.

   You know, when I read your second paragraph, I couldn't help but recall
   the accumulation of enormous wealth held by the Archdiocese of Sydney
   and the appropriation of power from the people that it gave George Pell
   and wonder how many times this situation is replicated universally.
   When Pope Francis urges the cardinals, etc, to come out of their
   palaces and give to the poor, does he really thinks this is going to
   happen because it would mean surrendering power which parallels
   accumulated wealth taken from the people, both rich and poor. These
   days, we are not in a position to criticise anyone.

   Andrew’s concept is too simplistic. Groups have specific that need to
   address other sensitivities, needs and cultural expectations. Part of
   Australia’s problem has been the selective bias of Australian
   historians and their anti-British sentiments. Pam is mistaken.
   Australian historians as writers and artists have not contributed
   greatly to public awareness, except to prolong a negative myth. Living
   with an isolated ‘Traditional Mob’ for 12 months made me realize how
   complex traditional Aboriginal problems are in choosing remote
   homelands. Their issues require totally separate answers to their
   ‘urban brothers’. Various Australian Federal governments of both
   persuasions attempted unsuccessfully to address, with integrity,
   monumental problems. The more radical ‘Aboriginal’ leaders impose a
   “New Imperialism” on their indigenous ‘brothers’ much as ATSIC did –
   and failed to do. Those who do not study history repeat it.

   The Australian political discourse is largely a middle class argument
   about middle class power. Even to use the word ‘discourse’ is middle
   class, but self-awareness helps us be aware of others. Andrew’s words
   cut across our simple reactions to racial bigotry by going to the heart
   of how such attitudes can be institutionalised in our society. It is
   about our wealth and power, whether we are the ones with lots of it, or
   little of it, which is why Karl Cameron-Jackson must be rebuked for
   saying Andrew is being simplistic. Our society is complex, but the
   powers have the means to divide and abuse, and this can happen at any
   level of the society. Once racial hatred is given license there are
   people who do not question their own prejudices. It is wrong of KCJ to
   say “Australian historians as writers and artists have not contributed
   greatly to public awareness, except to prolong a negative myth.” This
   generalisation has to be rebuked too. History is about asking
   questions, including questions about race relations, and if anything
   Australians should spend more time reading our historians who address
   this question, rather than claiming they haven’t contributed anything.
   Andrew’s contribution is astute. He uses South Africa to mirror what is
   happening and could happen in the future here in Australia, if we
   choose not to identify the root causes of our racial intolerance

Asylum seeker ethics is simple

     * Andrew Hamilton
     * 20 March 2014

   Asked whether they think the government's treatment of asylum seekers
   is right, some people will withhold judgment, arguing that the question
   is ethically complex; asylum seeker policy must take into account many
   issues, and an ethical judgment must await consideration of all these
   factors. This position is mistaken. The ethical questions are quite
   simple. The complexities and confusions arise only after we have
   answered them.
