   Many commentators argue that South Africa has not changed fundamentally
   since apartheid, and that racial inequality has continued because the
   basic structures of the old system have remained untransformed. Owen
   Crankshaw challenges these views and argues that the labour market in
   Gauteng, South Africa’s largest province, has been dramatically
   restructured.

   By Owen Crankshaw

   Many scholars and commentators hold the view that South African cities
   have not changed substantially since the end of apartheid. They argue
   that racial inequality has persisted because the basic structures of
   apartheid have not been dismantled. Some even go so far as to say that
   racial inequality persists because of continuing racial discrimination
   and oppression by white people.

   My research on employment trends in Gauteng over the period 1970 to
   2011 has produced evidence that challenges this view in several ways.
   First, the results show that the labour market in Gauteng has not
   remained the same since the end of apartheid. On the contrary, it was
   dramatically restructured, producing new winners and new losers in ways
   that substantially undermined the old apartheid order.

   In 1970, unemployment was very low, and most workers were employed in
   manual jobs, either as unskilled labourers or as machine operators and
   assembly-line workers. Forty years later, unemployment was extremely
   high, and most workers were employed in non-manual jobs, as clerks,
   sales and service workers, technicians, professionals and managers.
   This changing labour market, which benefitted better-educated workers
   and severely disadvantaged poorly-educated manual workers, also
   substantially changed the pattern of racial inequality.

   For white workers, this resulted in their continued prosperity, which
   took the form of a low unemployment rate and their over-representation
   in high-income technical, professional and managerial middle-class
   jobs. However, white workers were not the only people to benefit from
   the growth of middle-class jobs. The growth of high-income middle-class
   jobs far exceeded the supply of the white workforce and therefore
   provided middle-class employment opportunities for many well-educated
   black, mostly African, workers.

   The same trend took place in middle-income non-manual clerical,
   services and sales occupations. These non-manual occupations grew more
   than other occupational groups, resulting in dramatic upward
   occupational mobility among better-educated black workers. By contrast,
   there was very little employment growth in manual jobs, in which mostly
   poorly-educated black workers were employed. In particular, there was
   almost no employment growth among middle-income machine operators and
   assemblers, which dealt a terrible blow to the gains made by the
   unionised black working class.

   The result was therefore upward occupational mobility for many black
   workers into non-manual jobs. Although by 2011 white workers were still
   over-represented in high-income middle-class jobs, the black middle
   class was much larger than the white middle class. As far as clerical,
   sales and services jobs are concerned, the number of black workers had
   grown to the extent that white workers were no longer over-represented
   in these jobs.

   However, this changing division of labour severely disadvantaged a
   great many poorly-educated black workers who were left jobless by the
   shortage of manual jobs. The combined effects of racially-unequal
   schooling during the apartheid period, generally low employment growth
   and the changing occupational structure meant that it was
   poorly-educated black workers who bore the brunt of an extremely high
   level of unemployment. By 2011, the number of unemployed black workers
   was substantially more than the number of middle-class black workers.

The evidence

1. De-industrialization and the changing occupational and earnings structure
of employment

   In 1970, at the height of the apartheid period, the labour market was
   dominated by the manufacturing sector and characterized by a low
   unemployment rate of only 5 per cent. Four decades later, in 2011,
   employment in the manufacturing sector was less than each of the
   services sectors. Furthermore, unemployment had grown to 26 per cent.
   In 1970, the manufacturing sector was the single largest employer,
   employing almost one-quarter of all workers. By 2011, this percentage
   had shrunk to only 10 per cent. Correspondingly, employment in the
   service sectors increased in absolute and relative terms. Most notable,
   employment in community, social and personal services grew from only 12
   per cent in 1970 to 21 per cent by 2011. Similarly, employment in
   producer services grew from only 5 per cent to 21 per cent (Figure 1).

   Figure 1. Employment change in the largest economic sectors in Gauteng,
   1970 to 2011 (Error bars indicate the 95% confidence intervals).

   Over the same period, the occupational structure of employment changed
   substantially. In 1970, 64 per cent of all workers were employed in
   low-income and middle-income manual jobs. By 2011, employment in these
   manual jobs had declined to only 40 per cent. Correspondingly,
   employment in high-income managerial, professional and technical jobs
   increased from 19 per cent of all employment in 1970 to 28 per cent in
   2011. Similarly, middle-income clerical, sales and services jobs
   increased from 14 per cent of all employment in 1970 to 31 per cent in
   2011 (Figure 2). So, over a period of forty years, the occupational
   structure was transformed from one that was dominated by low- and
   middle-income manual workers to one that was dominated by middle- and
   high-income non-manual workers.

   Figure 2. Employment by low-, middle- and high-income occupational
   groups in Gauteng, 1970 to 2011. (Error bars indicate the 95%
   confidence intervals).

   The labour market therefore changed from one that required workers
   mostly without a secondary-school education to one that required
   workers mostly with a completed secondary-school education or more.
   Between 1970 and 2011, the employment of workers without a completed
   secondary-school education stagnated. By contrast, the employment of
   workers with a completed secondary and tertiary education increased
   dramatically.

   This changing occupational structure of employment was therefore a
   partial cause of rising unemployment. The reason for this is that about
   60 per cent of unemployed workers did not complete their secondary
   schooling and about 60 per cent of employed workers had completed their
   secondary or tertiary education. Over the period from 1980 to 2011,
   which is the period when the unemployment rate increased, two-thirds of
   all employment growth among workers with at least a completed secondary
   school education took place in middle- and high-income non-manual jobs.

   The other important reason for the high unemployment rate was the
   overall slow growth of employment in the face of a faster growth in the
   size of the population. Whereas from 1970 to 1980, when the
   unemployment rate remained low, the increase in the size of the
   economically active population was matched by employment growth.
   Between 1980 to 2001, the period during which the unemployment rate
   increased, the growth rate of the economically active population grew
   faster than the growth rate of employment. This explains why the
   unemployment rate is highest, not only among poorly-educated workers,
   but also among younger workers who entered the labour market during the
   period when employment growth was low and there was therefore a severe
   shortage of jobs.

2. The changing pattern of racial inequality

   Although the occupational profile of white workers remained largely
   unchanged, the occupational profile of black workers changed
   substantially over the period from 1970 to 2011. In 1970, almost all
   black workers were employed in low-income and middle-income manual
   jobs. By 2011, this percentage had decreased to just less than 50 per
   cent. The remaining black workers were employed in high-income
   middle-class and middle-income non-manual occupations. This
   transformation resulted in the racial desegregation of employment in
   middle-class and clerical, sales and service occupations that were once
   predominantly filled by white workers. In 1970, at the height of the
   apartheid period, about 90 per cent of all high-income middle-class
   jobs were held by white workers. Forty years later, this percentage was
   reduced to only one-third (Figure 3). Similarly, the percentage of
   black workers in clerical, sales and service jobs increased from 50 per
   cent in 1970 to almost 80 per cent in 2011.

   Figure 3. The changing racial composition of high-income, middle-class
   employment in Gauteng, 1970 to 2011. (Error bars indicate the 95%
   confidence intervals).

   So, contrary to the argument that the old apartheid labour market has
   persisted, the evidence suggests that there were dramatic changes that
   have produced new kinds of earnings inequalities. First, the demand for
   labour shifted away from poorly-educated manual workers to
   better-educated non-manual workers. In the face of a small and
   slow-growing white workforce, this resulted in the dramatic increase in
   the numbers of black workers employed in high-earning middle-class jobs
   and in middle-income non-manual jobs. Second, the rise of unemployment
   resulted in widespread poverty among poorly-educated black (mostly
   African) workers.

   Both these features of the labour market did not exist at the height of
   the apartheid period and therefore cannot be the result of the
   persistence of the racially oppressive apartheid system. South Africa
   therefore needs to urgently apply new solutions to these new causes of
   inequality. Specifically, the country must fix its secondary school
   system and expand its universities. South Africa must also encourage
   labour-intensive job creation in all sectors to reduce unemployment.

   Owen Crankshaw teaches sociology at the University of Cape Town. He has
   written and researched widely on labour, labour markets, class and
   cities in South Africa.

   Owen Crankshaw’s new book, Urban Inequality: Theory, evidence and
   method in Johannesburg is being published by Zed Books later in
   February.
