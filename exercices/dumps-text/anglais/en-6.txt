Fact Sheet: U.S. Efforts to Combat Systemic Racism

    1. [64]Home
    2. [65]Briefing Room
    3. [66]Statements and Releases

   "The prevalence, and pervasiveness, of racial discrimination might make
   the situation look hopeless, but we remain hopeful. Let us expose the
   racism and racial discrimination endemic to every society, around the
   globe. Let us press forward, to root out that discrimination and remove
   the rot from our foundations. And on this day dedicated to ending
   racial discrimination, let us leave our children a less hateful, more
   hopeful world."

   -- U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations, Linda Thomas-Greenfield

   Combating systemic racism requires aggressive action to address
   structures, policies, and practices that contribute to the wealth gap,
   to health disparities, and to inequalities in educational access,
   outcomes, and beyond. Today, on the occasion of the United Nations'
   (UN) International Day for the Elimination of Racial Discrimination,
   the United States reiterates its determination to address these
   challenges at home and abroad, and to make clear to the world that
   nations with genuine devotion to human rights and equality do not
   conceal their own failings - they confront them honestly,
   transparently, and with a determination to make things right.

   Here is what the administration is doing to address systemic racism:

   Advancing Racial Equity in the Federal Government: On Day 1 of this
   administration, the President issued Executive Order (EO) 13985 which
   established that the Federal Government should pursue a comprehensive
   approach to advancing equity for all and creating opportunities for the
   improvement of communities that have been historically underserved.

   Condemning and Combating Racism, Xenophobia, and Intolerance Against
   the Asian American and Pacific Islander (AAPI) Community: On January
   26, President Biden issued a Memorandum Condemning and Combating
   Racism, Xenophobia, and Intolerance against Asian Americans and Pacific
   Islanders in the United States. The memorandum orders executive
   departments and agencies to take all appropriate steps to ensure that
   official actions, documents, and statements, including those that
   pertain to the COVID-19 pandemic, do not exhibit or contribute to
   racism, xenophobia, and intolerance against Asian Americans and Pacific
   Islanders.

   Assessing Domestic Violent Extremism: President Biden directed the U.S.
   government interagency to study the threat of domestic violent
   extremism in the United States. Earlier this week, the Office of the
   Director of National Intelligence released the unclassified executive
   summary of the comprehensive assessment acknowledging that domestic
   violent extremist motivations include biases against minority
   populations.

   Creating a Chief Diversity and Inclusion Officer (CDIO) at the State
   Department: Secretary of State Blinken created the position of a Chief
   Diversity and Inclusion Officer (CDIO) at the State Department, in
   recognition of the crucial role diversity, equity, and inclusion can
   and should play in U.S. foreign policy. Reporting directly to the
   Secretary, the CDIO will align and advance Diversity and Inclusion
   policies across the department, bring transparency to these
   initiatives, and hold senior leadership accountable on progress.

   Incorporating Racial Justice into U.S. Foreign Policy Goals: Addressing
   systemic racism andstrengthening democracy in the United States is a
   critical part ofPresident Biden'sforeign policy vision. The Secretary
   of State shall submit a report to the appropriate congressional
   committees describing initiatives that address racial and ethnic
   discrimination abroad, to include a list of Department efforts that
   explicitly focus on addressing racial and ethnic prejudice and
   discriminations, funding for civil society grants and Embassy programs
   and initiatives, exchange and leadership programs, and related efforts.
   This includes State Department programming through the Bureau of
   Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor (DRL) and the U.S. Agency for
   International Development (USAID).

   Supporting Historically Marginalized Populations Around the World:
   Globally, the United States supports organizations to empower racial
   and ethnic minority communities, and uphold the dignity of people who
   are systematically denied their human rights and fundamental freedoms.
   Programs support locally-led efforts to combat all types of racial and
   ethnic hatred and violence and facilitate access to justice for victims
   of racism. Initiatives are intersectional and support individuals who
   face discrimination on account of gender identity and expression,
   sexual orientation, disability, race or ethnicity, religion, and
   national origin.

   Calling for Action at the UN Human Rights Council: At the UN Human
   Rights Council, more than 140 nations joined the United States in a
   statement outlining the continuing scourge of racism and racial
   discrimination, xenophobia, and other forms of intolerance. This
   historic cross-regional statement is a call to action for all nations
   to:
     * acknowledge and address the legacy and persistence of systemic
       racism
     * review and revise long-standing practices and policies to ensure
       all individuals are treated equally
     * embed fairness and inclusivity in decision-making processes
     * redress inequities in policies that serve as barriers to equal
       opportunity
     * eliminate barriers to political participation

   Nominating a U.S. Representative to the Committee on the Elimination of
   Racial Discrimination: The United States nominated Professor Gay
   McDougall to serve on the Committee on the Elimination of Racial
   Discrimination, a body of 18 independent experts that monitors
   implementation of the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of
   Racial Discrimination by its State parties. Her nomination underscores
   the value that the Biden administration places on the Committee's work.
