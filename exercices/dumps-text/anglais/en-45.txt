Family of 10-year-old accused of groping school employee fights allegations,
racial discrimination
     __________________________________________________________________

   [22]Danielle Johnson   | The Daytona Beach News-Journal

   DAYTONA BEACH, Fla. -- A family is demanding action from Volusia County
   Schools after a district mental health counselor pressed charges
   against a [23]10-year-old student whom [24]she accused of groping her.

   The incident has made national headlines -- and even provided material
   to [25]Saturday Night Live -- but the family says the boy did not grab
   the employee's breast during a hug like she reported to the Holly Hill
   Police Department. They have hired an attorney to defend the boy, who
   served a 10-day suspension from school and is still facing simple
   battery charges.

   In addition to clearing the boy's record, the family is demanding the
   school district fire the employee and discipline others involved.

   "We will not stand by this and allow him to be accused of something
   that he did not do," Ed Hollins, the boy's grandfather, said at a
   virtual press conference Monday morning. "I would not stand for my
   grandchild or any child to be treated this way by a professional. This
   is a new way of lynching."

   student after she says she was groped

   The family, along with attorney Rawsi Williams and [27]West Volusia
   NAACP President Sean King, said the boy is among the latest of many
   Black students who have been disproportionately and more severely
   punished by the Volusia County school system.

   "Over the last two years of being president, this is a weekly call that
   I'm getting with situations of this nature, especially with the Volusia
   County school system, where our Black and brown kids are put on the
   wrong end of every situation, and no matter how you confront the issue,
   it continues to happen," King said, calling the incident a "travesty."

   The News-Journal, a part of the USA TODAY Network, does not name or
   publish photos of juveniles accused of crimes. It is also not naming
   the district employee, who has opted into [28]Marsy's Law to protect
   her privacy.

Employee accused boy of groping her

   The district mental health counselor reported the alleged incident Oct.
   24.

   A suspension letter sent to the boy's guardians stated the counselor
   was in the student's classroom discussing another student when the
   class returned from lunch and the child "approached (the counselor) to
   hug her."

   "(The counselor) turned sideways to give a side hug," the report
   stated. "(The student) put his left arm around her shoulder and then
   with his right hand he reached and grabbed her left breast in which she
   had to grab his wrist and remove his hand."

   The explanation states that the student "proceeded to smirk and walk
   away" and later "began yelling and kicking things and stormed off" when
   his primary teacher called him to ask about the incident.

   The Holly Hill Police Department report, which the employee
   subsequently filed, stated that the incident, which was reported as a
   simple battery, happened around 11:30 a.m. to noon.

   That report states that the counselor saw the student running toward
   her and turned her body. The student hugged her and then "cupped her
   left breast in a disrespectful way," and she had to "forcibly remove
   his hand," she told police.

   The report also notes that the primary teacher in the classroom did not
   witness the incident, but tried to talk to the student about it
   afterward.

Black students disproportionately disciplined, attorney says

   The family disputes the counselor's version of the incident and notes
   there were no witnesses. They also object to the school district's
   handling of the "wrongful suspension."

   "That really hit me really hard that a mental health specialist could
   accuse my grandson of (that), and then the wording that she used, it
   was so graphic, like he's some kind of sex maniac or something. It's
   like, this really hurts," the boy's grandmother, Lakesha Hollins, said
   after wiping away tears with a tissue.

   The family's pastor, Cynthia Williams, said the boy is loving, kind,
   honest and well-mannered.

   The child's father, whom The News-Journal is not naming to protect the
   boy's identity, said he was at a loss for words when the boy asked if
   people would look at him as a "monster" rather than as himself when he
   returns to school.

   The family is awaiting a meeting to allow the boy to return to school
   and has requested he be put in a different classroom and have no
   contact with the counselor. The district considered whether to expel
   the 10-year-old but did not find enough evidence to do so.

   "Time and time again, we have seen Volusia County Schools violate the
   rights of their Black students," Williams, the family's Miami-based
   attorney, said.

   Williams has previously defended [30]two Black students who accused
   district employees of putting them in chokeholds in two separate
   incidents.

   She said calls that she gets from minority families are often related
   to suspension or extreme discipline, such as choking or "unwarranted
   and excessive physical contact." Non-minority families more often reach
   out to her about bullying and less severe incidents.

Family wants record cleared, charges dropped and apology

   In this situation, Williams is asking the school district to reverse
   the boy's suspension; expunge the incident from his record; apologize
   to the family; terminate the mental health counselor; and discipline
   the school's principal and the other teacher in the room, whom they say
   yelled at the boy and wrongfully accused him, even though she did not
   witness it.

   Williams says they have already contacted the Florida Department of
   Education to file complaints against the licenses and certifications of
   the counselor, teacher and principal. They also plan to file complaints
   against Volusia County Schools with the U.S. Department of Education
   for the "well-known and pervasive pattern" of racial discrimination
   within the district.

   She said the district failed to follow its own policy for investigation
   and discipline, as it did not comply with the family's request to meet
   with the school and did not notify the family of a meeting to uphold
   the suspension.

   suicide to sue for school's response to bullying

   Williams also noted the suspension notice was not signed by the school
   and left several boxes blank regarding whether the child had been given
   a chance to present his version or deny the charges, as well as whether
   the parent was called.

   VCS Director of Communications Angel Gomez previously shared via email
   that a District Student Placement Committee determines whether to
   recommend students for expulsion. He said the committee meets privately
   and no one else is allowed at the meetings, but parents and guardians
   could appeal a decision afterward.

   "The student has been disciplined to the extent of the student code of
   conduct. Under Florida law, teachers remain private citizens and school
   districts cannot encourage nor prohibit the exercise of criminal
   charges or prosecutions by employees," Gomez wrote on Monday. "Volusia
   County Schools is not able to make any comments regarding any
   disciplinary action on a student or any action taken by a staff member
   involving student discipline."

   Even if he did accidentally touch the counselor, Williams says the
   discipline was not "restorative and logical," as a [32]document on the
   district's discipline procedures states. That phrasing, which appears
   in a 2020 introduction to the student conduct code, says discipline
   should make "sense to everyone involved," and that "teaching students
   to really think about how their behavior affects others" is key.

   "Reasonable adults would have said, `This was an accident,' and moved
   on," she said.

   On a second stage, Williams is prepared to fight the pending charge
   filed with the Holly Hill Police Department if it moves forward.

   She said the police department has instructed that the charge would be
   dropped if the student attended a program for the alleged deviancy,
   which they are opposing on the grounds that the boy did nothing wrong.

   A third course may be to demand damages from the school district
   through a federal lawsuit for violating the boy's rights, which could
   unfold further down the road.
