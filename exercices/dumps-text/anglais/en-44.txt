   Film producer Randall Emmett has settled a lawsuit brought by a former
   assistant who had accused him of racial discrimination and creating a
   hostile workplace that included the use of the N-word.

   Martin G'Blae, 29, who worked at the production company Emmett/Furla
   Oasis for much of 2020, [130]brought a lawsuit in Los Angeles Superior
   Court earlier this month. The complaint contained 24 claims of alleged
   legal violations, including that Emmett had allegedly asked G'Blae to
   transport cocaine and file an insurance claim for a missing Rolls
   Royce, which G'Blae had maintained wasn't actually stolen.

   G'Blae had served as a production assistant on Emmett's action movie
   "Midnight in the Switchgrass" with Bruce Willis.

   G'Blae, who is Black, had alleged that race discrimination was a factor
   in his termination.

   The lawsuit against Emmett alleges that the producer called rapper 50
   Cent the N-word during an office outburst in 2020.

   "The parties have discussed their claims and potential claims against
   each other and as a result of these discussion, Mr. G'Blae's complaint
   is being dismissed with prejudice," G'Blae's lawyer Young K. Park said
   Wednesday in a brief statement. Park declined to comment beyond that.

   Financial terms were not disclosed.

   "Mr. G'Blae has decided to dismiss his complaint and Mr. Emmett has
   agreed to not pursue damages for what he strenuously maintains were
   false allegations made against him," Suann MacIsaac, Emmett's attorney
   at the Kinsella Weitzman law firm, said in a statement. "The matter is
   now closed."

   G'Blae's attorneys and those representing Emmett and his business
   partner, George Furla, worked to quickly resolve the complaint, which
   asserted that Emmett made racist comments about Black performers,
   including rappers 50 Cent, Cardi B and Quavo. Both sides appeared
   motivated to avoid drawn-out litigation or a bruising trial.

   Quavo, an Atlanta rapper, co-stars in an Emmett-directed Robert De Niro
   movie, "Savage Salvation," that is scheduled for release next month.

   Several of G'Blae's complaints were described in a Los Angeles Times
   [134]investigation last summer into Emmett's crumbling empire. The
   Times detailed allegations of mistreatment of women, assistants and
   investors who poured millions of dollars into Emmett's film projects.
   Several financiers are now suing Emmett and Furla for civil fraud,
   which both men deny.

[138]The man who played Hollywood: Inside Randall Emmett's crumbling empire

   The ex-fiance of reality star Lala Kent faces the collapse of his
   company amid a trail of lawsuits, civil fraud charges and allegations
   of abusive behavior.

   The filing comes amid a rising tide of [139]discontent among Hollywood
   assistants, who have spoken out about low wages and harsh treatment by
   Hollywood executives.

   Emmett has been a fixture in Hollywood for two decades, [140]producing
   more than 120 movies, including low-budget action films [141]starring
   Bruce Willis, Sylvester Stallone and Mel Gibson. Emmett also has
   co-produced critically acclaimed movies, including Peter Berg's "Lone
   Survivor" and two Martin Scorsese films, "Silence" and the
   Oscar-nominated "The Irishman" for Netflix.

   G'Blae, who was paid $1,500 every two weeks, said in the complaint that
   he was on call 12 hours a day and on weekends, resulting in pay that
   amounted to less than California's minimum wage. In addition, G'Blae
   said he was often asked to cover Emmett's personal expenses, including
   meals and stays, without full reimbursement.
